Before running `npm start`, make sure you have `mongod` running in another command prompt.

At the time of writing, I'm receiving a `TypeError: Weather.insert is not a function` error.

~~An hour has passed. I still can't resolve the above TypeError and it makes me very sad. :(
StackOverflow doesn't help with this at all.~~

I wasted a bunch of time trying to use Weather.insert() instead of new Weather.save().

:(((((
