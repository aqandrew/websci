Your Shoe's Untied,"[The episode starts off in SpongeBob's living room with him watching a sea anemone dancing on TV, his eyes widen and he moves a little closer. Gary comes up.]",
Your Shoe's Untied,Gary, Meow.
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Gary! [changes channel to a football game] Uh, uh, I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary. [Someone is knocking on his door.] Come in!"
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick," [Opens door and walks in] Hey, SpongeBob, wanna see my new shoes? [shows blue tennis shoes]"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Wow! Those are great, Patrick! Let's see what they look like on your feet."
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, Uh... [pulls the shoes away] Wouldn't you rather see them on... [shows the shoes on his hands] My hands?
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Okay... [has white gloves on his feet] And we can wear gloves on our feet [turns around and has a top hat on his back] and hats on our captain's quarters, too. [shakes his butt]"
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick," Uh, actually... I have a confession to make. [looks to see that no one is watching, leans to SpongeBob's ""ear"" and whispers] I don't know how to tie my shoelaces."
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob, [laughs] Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, Yes. [SpongeBob places one foot on the chair]
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob, Look at this knot. Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow?
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, Gosh... Probably not.
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there [Points off-screen behind himself] and let an old pro show you how to do it. [Patrick sits down in the chair and SpongeBob sets his foot on the chair's arm] Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start [unties his laces] by taking one lace per hand... [pulls a little on both laces] And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the..."
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, Are you sure you know how to do it?
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I?"
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, [SpongeBob gives him a dirty look] Your shoes are still untied. [SpongeBob takes his shoe off the chair]
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," [looks away] Well, [Patrick looks shocked] I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it."
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, I'm sorry! [covers his mouth with his shoes] I won't interrupt anymore!
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin. [sets his right foot on the chair arm and unties his laces. Ties his laces but they come undone. SpongeBob laughs nervously and tries again but the laces untie themselves once more. Patrick looks angry at him] That's... ""knot"" right. [laughs nervously] Get it? Knot... right... hmm..."
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick, No.
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Okay, no more fooling around. [tries to tie the laces again off-screen] I've got it! [lifts up hands to show his fingers tied in a lot of knots. He laughs nervously. He turns around.]"
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick," What was that? Are you okay, SpongeBob?"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," [He turns around and looks angry at Patrick] Patrick, aren't you late for something?"
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick," Oh, poop deck, You're right! [runs and bursts down SpongeBob's front door] We'll have to do this lesson  [Off-Screen] later! Bye SpongeBob!"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," I can't believe I've forgotten how to tie my own shoes. They've been tied as long as I can remember. [flashbacks to being him as an egg with legs, socks, and shoes only] Well, I'll remember after a good night's sleep. [The scene changes to show the night scene with the island and the moon is shown. The scene changes to show the sunrise scene with the island is then shown shown. The scene changes to show SpongeBob is shown sleeping in his bed snoring with his shoelaces going back and forth. the clock turns to 700 am. The alarm goes off. SpongeBob wakes up and looks at his shoes and they are still untied] Oh... No big deal. I'll remember sooner or later. [The scene changes to show the outside of the Pineapple and he opens the front door. He is shown wearing his Krusty Krab uniform.] 'Cause I'm ready! I'm... read... [takes a step and trips] ...y! [stands up] I'm read... [takes another step and trips] ...Ooh! [stands up] I'm read... [takes another step and trips] ... Uh! [stands up] I'm read... [takes another step and trips] ...Ooy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Uh! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Duh! [repeats a few times]"
Your Shoe's Untied,[He makes it to the Krusty Krab where Patrick is eating a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob trips through the doors Patrick notices SpongeBob.],
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick," Oh, hi, SpongeBob."
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," [gasps] Oh, no! I can't let Patrick see I still haven't tied my shoes. [stands up and puts two holes through the floor with his feet]"
Your Shoe's Untied,Patrick," [Walks over to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob... You're shorter. Have you been dieting?"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest. [walks to the kitchen putting a line of holes in the floor with his feet] Well, I've gotta get to work. [opens kitchen door and plops on the floor, face first. He grunts. He talks muffled by the fact that he hasn't stood up yet and is talking straight into the floor.] Oh, barnacles! maybe I should just lay here."
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward," [peeks his head through the order window] Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob."
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob, He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties! [he holds out a spatula and gets up] Laces or no laces! [crawls over to the grill while grunting] Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot. [makes a krabby patty] Ta-da! A perfect patty.
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward," Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over. Well?"
Your Shoe's Untied,[SpongeBob takes a deep breath. Then imagines that Squidward is really far away. He also imagines his shoe laces as snakes that squeeze him then the hallucination goes away.],
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea! How about you come get it?"
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward," [Sarcastically] Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea. And maybe I should cook the patties and do the dishes and wear square pants and live in a pineapple while you wait in the unemployment line!"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob, No!
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward, Then bring that patty here now!
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," [Off-Screen] Okay, Squidward. [On-Screen] Here I come. I'm coming over. [scoots his feet across the floor inch by inch] I'm bringing the patty to you. Here comes the patty. No problem. I'm walking...the Krabby Patty...over to Squidward. All right, Squidward. I'm giving you the patty... For the hungry customer... So they can eat it... When I give it to you... Which is right... now. [holds out the patty but the scene zooms out to show that SpongeBob never moved]"
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward," Uh, SpongeBob? I'm over here! Now move!"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Okay, Squidward. [looks down at his feet] Just slowly move your leg. Walk over there... with the... [tries to take a step but trips himself and sends the patty flying through the air at Squidward] Dah!"
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward, SpongeBob! [the patty lands in his mouth]
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," I'm sorry, Squidward."
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward, [chewing the patty] SpongeBob!
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob, I'll just make another... Doh! [makes another patty but trips again throwing the patty towards Squidward]
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward, Sponge... [patty enters his mouth]
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," Hold it... Doy! [makes another patty and trips again sending the patty into Squidwards mouth again] Let me just... [makes another patty] Doy! [he trips again and launches another patty. This continues for a while. Pretty soon, Squid is extremely huge. A group of customers is standing at the register. Old Man Jenkins pokes him.]"
Your Shoe's Untied,Old Man Jenkins, What's the holdup?
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward, [Squidward turns around and burps really loudly] I think my heart just stopped. [customers complain] It's Sponge... [burps] ...Bob's fault! ['SpongeBob's fault' echoes in SpongeBob's head]
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," [He starts to tear up] I've failed. My career is over. I'm sorry, spatula. [puts down the spatula and takes his hat off] I'm sorry, hat. [puts it back on] I'm sorry, floor. [Takes a box of Krabby Patties from the wall and brings it to him and hugs it.] I am sorry, Krabby Patties. [lies in a puddle of tears. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs on the toilet working on a crossword puzzle, all of the answers he has given is the word ""Money"".]"

Your Shoe's Untied,Customer, [Off-Screen] This is the worst service we've ever had! We're going to the Chum Bucket! [Mr. Krabs opens the bathroom door to see what the problem is]
Your Shoe's Untied,Mr. Krabs, Wait! Wait! Don't go! [his pants are on the ground]
Your Shoe's Untied,Harold," Oh yeah, we are definitely out of here. [The costumers continue to complain. Mr. Krabs runs over to the door, his pants are still on the ground.]"
Your Shoe's Untied,Mr. Krabs," Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?"
Your Shoe's Untied,Squidward, It's SpongeBob's fault. [Mr. Krabs gets upset. His eyes turn into steamboat whistles]
Your Shoe's Untied,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, get out here! [peeks out the kitchen door] More. [SpongeBob peeks out a little more] More. [SpongeBob stretches himself partially through the door] All the way, boy! [SpongeBob snaps out of the door and falls to the ground.] What be the matter, SpongeBob? I ought to make you walk the plank for this."
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob," I'm sorry Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I..."

Your Shoe's Untied,Flying Dutchman," Then you've come to the right flying ghost, kid. You're looking at the first place winner in the fancy knottin' contest for the last 3,000 years!"
Your Shoe's Untied,SpongeBob, Hooray! [floats up into the air and turns into a heart]
Your Shoe's Untied,Flying Dutchman," [grabs SpongeBob] You're gonna have to not do that. And stop staring at me with them big old eyes. [SpongeBob's eyes shrink] Now, stand back and watch me be knotty. [laughs and pulls out a rope] Haha! Behold! [rope is in pretzel shape] The pretzel knot!"

Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol. [bell dings] No one ever comes in on Sunday.

[grabs the dime in the drain] I got it, boy. [tries to take his hand out] What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob, You've gotta let go of the dime.
Squid's Day Off,Mr. Krabs," I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave! [SpongeBob pulls on Mr. Krabs from behind a couple times until Mr. Krabs gets thrown back without his arms] Me arms!"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Oh no, not again!

You're in our thoughts. [The final paramedic enters the ambulance and it drives off.] Takes more muscles to frown than to smile. [shuts the door] Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give you a promotion."
Squid's Day Off,[SpongeBob's pupils form into stars to stars],
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob, [screams] Ahh! Really?
Squid's Day Off,Squidward, You get to run the cash register.
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?"

Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Me, too."

Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob, Squidward!
Squid's Day Off,Squidward, [He is half-way out the door] What is it?
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob, You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. [He rubs the cash register]
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own. [walks off as SpongeBob hugs the cash register]"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," I can't believe this is really happening. [sits on the cash register box. He starts to tear up.] Today, I start living!"
Squid's Day Off,[The scene changes to show Squidward walking outside],
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face. [scene cuts to Squidward's imagination Patrick and SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab with dopey looks on their faces]"
Squid's Day Off,Thought Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob!"
Squid's Day Off,Thought SpongeBob," Hey, Patrick!"
Squid's Day Off,Thought Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob could you give me change for a quarter? [holds up quarter]"
Squid's Day Off,Thought SpongeBob," No problem! [takes quarter, bangs on the register until it opens, and gives Patrick a giant pile of money] Here ya go!"
Squid's Day Off,Thought Patrick, Thanks.
Squid's Day Off,[the scene goes back to reality],
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," [gasps] I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh! [he runs back to the restaurant, banging the doors open] Sponge... [sees only SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab] ...Bob. [checks the cash register to see if everything is still there. Gives a sigh of relief]"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar. [He pulls out a dollar from his pocket]"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Do you want four quarters? [holds up four quarters] Or ten dimes? [shows ten dimes on his left hand] Or twenty nickels? [shows ten nickels on each arm] Or one hundred pennies? [shows one-hundred pennies on his back] Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies? [shows the quarter on his nose, 3 dimes on his fingers, 7 nickels on his thumb, and ten pennies, in the shape of the cent symbol, on his foot] Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are..."
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Alright, goodbye. [walks off. Scene changes to show Squidward's house where he comes out wearing sunglasses and blue shorts or bathing suit, he is carrying a lawn chair, a sunbathing mirror, an umbrella hat and a bottle of sunscreen.] This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation. [sets his lawn chair down, puts the hat on, puts the mirror down, and puts sunscreen on his nose.] I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah..."
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," [voice over/Thoughts] Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored. [imagines SpongeBob behind the counter just standing there. Squidward chuckles.] SpongeBob, bored. [he chuckles some more]"
Squid's Day Off,Thought SpongeBob," Ehh... Gettin' kinda bored. [yawns and falls asleep snoring. Krusty Krab spontaneously combusts and Squidward tries to blow it out but its a thought bubble, so it goes away. Begins to run to the Krusty Krab but stops.]"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Oh, what am I doing? [he pulls out a pocket watch] I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire. [he walks back down the road, chuckling. Then, a fire truck drives down the road from to direction of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is startled and runs to the restaurant with a fire extinguisher. He opens the door and sprays the galley with foam. As the foam subsides, Squidward, now with a foam beard, walks over to SpongeBob, who has a foam mustache]"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," May I help you, sir?"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," [wipes off his foamy beard] It's me, you dunce!"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Oh, hi, Squidward! [mustache falls off] How are those errands going?"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward, What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Well, I'm sure you are."
Squid's Day Off,Squidward, I don't like your tone.
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob, [high-pitched voice] I'm sure you are. [normal voice again] How's that?
Squid's Day Off,Squidward, Just do your jobs! [walks off]
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles. [puts the spatula in his forehead. Squidward leaves, grumbling.] Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge. [The scene changes to show Squidward's house. The scene zooms into the interior. Squidward is trying to sit down.]"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Must... re... [cracks his back] ...lax! [He slouches in his chair. He pulls out a hand mirror] Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow. Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me. You will not go back to the Krusty Krab. [his reflection turns into SpongeBob]"
Squid's Day Off,Mirror SpongeBob, I will destroy the Krusty Krab! [Squidward screams and throws the mirror at the wall and runs to the Krusty Krab]

Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs back to his house then back to the Krusty Krab] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs back to his house] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab] Have you finished those errands? [Squidward keeps running back and forth while SpongeBob is repeating 'have you finished those errands?' Finally, Squidward enters the Krusty Krab and stops] Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be. So quit checking up on me! [walks up to SpongeBob] I know what you're up to. [He hits the cash register while he talks] Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob, But I haven't...
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Okay, [He leans on the cash register] maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will... [walks backwards] And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there! [He laughs and runs away.]"
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear these hats."
Squid's Day Off,"[The scene changes to show Squidward putting locks on his door, bolting it down with wood and nails, putting police tape up, and using a blowtorch to weld the door shut so he can't get out]",
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," There! [He throws the blowtorch backwards] Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself! [His face looks weird] I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care. [laughs] Just gonna... Relax. [He walks to his shower and turns on the water and puts on his bathing cap sits in his bathtub] Let Squid's day off...[Under the bath water] begin. [Squidward hears SpongeBob laughing] [above the bath water] What was that? [SpongeBob's laughing is heard again] It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me, to see if I'm really doing errands. [gives a chuckle] But, but he left his post. [Gives another chuckle] And I've finally caught him messing up. [Gives another chuckle. He pokes his head out the window.] Aha! I caught you, Sponge... [notices that its only the wind making a branch of coral brush against his house] ... Branch. [Squidward notices SpongeBob's silhouette with his two hats behind his shower curtain] Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get. [pulls the curtain aside] I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a... [Sees his toilet with a shampoo bottle and 2 rolls of toilet paper on it] ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say..."
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Hi, Squidward. [SpongeBob is in the bathtub with Squidward.] Are you finished with those errands yet? [goes under the water]"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Aha! [goes under the water and appears as a real octopus] I know you're in here. [gasps] What? [SpongeBob is in the drain. He winks and goes down] He's heading back to the Krusty Krab! I'll beat him there! [slams through the locked door with nothing on but his shower cap and bubbles foaming around his waist] I've got you now, SpongeBob!"
Squid's Day Off,Sadie," [covers her son's eyes with her hand] Hey, put some clothes on!"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward, [runs past Patrick lying on a rock] The truth will be revealed!
Squid's Day Off,Patrick," [stands up] Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward! [The scene changes to show the hospital where Purple Doctorfish and Mr. Krabs are walking out]"
Squid's Day Off,Purple Doctorfish," Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back. [walks inside]"
Squid's Day Off,Mr. Krabs," Thanks, Doc. [Squidward runs past him]"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," SpongeBob, you can't beat me! [Mr. Krabs' arms fall off and he walks back into the hospital. The Scene changes to show Squidward running into the Krusty Krab while laughing hysterically.] Aha! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! [SpongeBob looks confused] Or the toilet in my bathroom! And then you were in my bathtub, and I... And-and you... And I... And then you... Swam... Down the drain and... Beat me... to the Krusty... Krab."
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Uh, does that mean you're...? [Squidward covers SpongeBob's mouth with his hand]"
Squid's Day Off,Squidward," Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands. [hugs the register] I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do."
Squid's Day Off,[He rubs his face on the cash register. SpongeBob takes off his clothes (except his underwear) and hands them to Squidward],
Squid's Day Off,SpongeBob," Then you might wanna put these on. [Squidward looks down and notices a bunch of bubbles. They all pop, he grabs SpongeBob's pants and puts them on.] Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look! [walks back with the ""open""/""closed"" sign] We forgot to switch the ""Closed"" sign to ""Open"". [flips the sign from ""Closed"" to ""Open""]. It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! [He laughs. Squidward's nose falls off and his head deflates. His whole body soon falls gently to the ground.]"
Something Smells,"[The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown. The scene zooms into the interior of the pineapple, SpongeBob's bed room. His alarm clock goes off. SpongeBob gets up, still in his tighty-whities, puts his blanket on like a cape, and uses the wind of the alarm clock to ""fly"" at his big calendar. He lands on the 20th day, which is a Sunday]",
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?"
Something Smells,Gary, Meow.
Something Smells,SpongeBob," [The scene changes to show the two his kitchen. SpongeBob opens the door.] That's right! [puts a bowl on the kitchen counter] A sundae! [runs to the freezer and finds it empty] Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup! [Runs back to the bowl with a big bottle of Ketchup. He squeezes a bunch of ketchup into the bowl. He runs over to a cupboard] Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring. [closes cupboard door] Ah, here we go! Onions! [runs up to the counter with two sacks that say ""onions"" on them] Ready, Gary?"
Something Smells,Gary, Meow. [Plays a violin while SpongeBob cries while peeling the onions into the bowl]
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Just one more thing! Pea... [opens up another cupboard but finds an empty jar] ...nuts. Gary! [He walks over to Gary while shaking the empty jar] Our peanuts jar is totally empty! [Gary burps] Hmmm... [snaps fingers] Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts. [looks in the bathroom and finds a peanut plant in front of the window] Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill. [throws the plant into the sundae bowl] A little texture never hurt. There we go. [gets out a spoon] This sundae's gonna taste great! [He turns around] Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me! [takes a few spoonfuls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a bunch of stink coming out with him. He drops his spoon while Gary hides behind a coral plant] You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning. [""morning"" comes out of SpongeBob's mouth and wraps itself around Gary's eyes, twisting them. The scene changes to show SpongeBob outside his house] Okay, let's see my to-do list. [takes out a big long list] Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. [his list ""droops""]wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday. [takes out a small piece of paper] Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'. [runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob running up to a citizen] Hello. [citizen runs off in disgust of his bad breath. SpongeBob waves] Some people are even late on Sunday. [SpongeBob notices a mailman] Hi, mailfish! [mailman breaks his skin into a smaller fish and then into another smaller fish. SpongeBob notices a crossing guard] Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard! [crossing guard gets a whiff of his bad breath]"
Something Smells,Mrs. Crossing Guard, Mother of mercy! [children walk across the street and then the sound of a crashing car sounds but its revealed to actually be a parade]
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Wow! A parade! Hi, parade! [the band stops] Hi tuba player, hi drummer, hi guy with the cymbals, hi trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi timbale man, hi didgeridoo player, [didgeridoo player wears a big skirt, hat, sunglasses] hi triangle player, hi guy with the kettle drum, hi pianist, hi guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly! [the stench ball rolls down the street, knocking the band out like a bunch of bowling pins and scattering them about. They all run out wailing in pain and disgust. The whole town is soon deserted]"
Something Smells,Fish bands, My leg! My leg! [they all run away from the stench]
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Was it something I said? [he walks down the street] Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now... [he notices a giant pink wad on a bench] ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next? [Patrick's head pops out from it]"
Something Smells,Patrick," Hi, SpongeBob. [his appendages form from the wad]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused."
Something Smells,Patrick," Yes, I am."
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch. [he walks over to a building] Hi, building! [the stench bounces off the building, and it slowly moves away. SpongeBob walks back to Patrick] I just don't get it."
Something Smells,"[the stench goes toward Patrick, but bounces off him, as he has no nose]",
Something Smells,Patrick," I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed. [pan up slowly at SpongeBob's clothes, looking fancy]"
Something Smells,Both, Nah.
Something Smells,Patrick," Maybe it's your voice. [SpongeBob laughs  for an extended time, then stops]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Good one, Patrick."
Something Smells,Patrick," Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly."
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Ugly? [he puts a finger in his mouth, wipes his forehead with it, then strikes a pose. A spotlight goes off] You gotta be kiddin' me.."
Something Smells,Patrick, Better try the reflection test. [he pulls out a large mirror]
Something Smells,SpongeBob," [to his reflection] Hi. [the stench hits his reflection, and the reflection takes a hammer and breaks the mirror. Pat peeks through it]"
Something Smells,Patrick, Ugly.
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly! [he runs up to a couple] Am I ugly? [the two catch a whiff on the stench. The husband pulls down a hook, the two bites down on it and the hook is reeled in. SpongeBob runs off and latches onto a car's windshield] Am I ugly? [the stench goes around the glass and hits the woman]"
Something Smells,Driver, My eyes!
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Oof I'm ugly... [cut to night at SpongeBob's house. Lightning strikes repeatedly as Patrick walks in]
Something Smells,Patrick," SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads? [he walks through the dark house. He opens the library door. It's pitch dark, except for a light from the fire. SpongeBob mournfully plays Phantom of the Opera-style organ music. Patrick walks up to him, and he stops playing] SpongeBob? [the lights go on, and SpongeBob turns. He's wearing a Groucho Marx-esque nose and glasses, and a dark cape. He turns his back to Patrick]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am. [he hits down on the organ]
Something Smells,Patrick," Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up. [he picks SpongeBob up, without glasses or cape, up and puts him in his comfy chair] It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.' [SpongeBob listens attentively] Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end. [Patrick grins, oblivious to his story's bad message]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," That didn't help at all. [he starts sobbing] How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?"
Something Smells,Patrick," As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you. [SpongeBob clings on Patrick]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling! [Patrick smacks SpongeBob in the face, twisting his head around] Thanks Patrick. [Patrick holds his hand up again, and SpongeBob stops him, stammering] It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over."
Something Smells,Patrick," Just do what I do when I have problems. [screaming] Scream! [SpongeBob is covered with spit from Patrick. Patrick grabs SpongeBob and runs off] Come on buddy I'll help you. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the roof] Okay now, say it. [SpongeBob hesitates] Say it."
Something Smells,SpongeBob, I can't.
Something Smells,Patrick," SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest. [we see SpongeBob has a alien-like leach sucking on his chest]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," I know, Patrick. [he pulls it off and throws it aside]"
Something Smells,Patrick, Say it. Say it.
Something Smells,SpongeBob, I'm ugly.
Something Smells,Patrick, You're ugly and what...?
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Square?
Something Smells,Patrick, No. Proud.
Something Smells,SpongeBob, I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Something Smells,Patrick, Good! Say it louder.
Something Smells,SpongeBob, [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Something Smells,Patrick, Louder.
Something Smells,SpongeBob, [louder] I'm ugly and I'm proud.
Something Smells,Patrick, Louder!
Something Smells,SpongeBob," [yelling] I'm ugly and I'm proud! [pan over to Squidward's roof, where he's tanning] I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!"
Something Smells,Squidward, Is that what he calls it? [SpongeBob is breathing heavily]
Something Smells,SpongeBob, That felt great! I feel empowered.
Something Smells,Patrick, So whaddya wanna do now?
Something Smells,SpongeBob," I don't know. How about a movie? [cut to 'The Reef' movie theater. SpongeBob and Patrick walk into a crowded theater. The two go down the front row] Pardon me. Ugly Sponge coming through. [two fish smell SpongeBob's breath, their pupils turn to crosses, and they float upward]"
Something Smells,Patrick, People respect self esteem. [he and SpongeBob sit down in the two now empty seats. SpongeBob leans over to a woman sitting next to him]
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway. [the stench burns the woman's eyes, complexion, and hair off, and her head is now all charred. SpongeBob leans over Patrick to the man beside Patrick, who is a blue version of Fred] Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you."
Something Smells,Fred," Not at all, boy. [Smells SpongeBob's bad breath. Makes a sourly disgusted expression, screams out a disgusted noise, and then quickly runs away]"
Something Smells,Patrick," [to SpongeBob] Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a- [he notices his friend crying] SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," [sobbing]I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried, [he turns around, revealing an extremely deflated face] but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide. [Patrick goes from sad to angry]"
Something Smells,Patrick," [loudly] What is wrong with you people?! [he stands up] Afraid to look ugliness in the face? [he picks up SpongeBob] Well, here! Look at it! [the stench pours into the audience] It's ugly, isn't it?! [he points SpongeBob at five people] You look at it!"
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Hello.
Something Smells,[The fish run off. Patrick points SpongeBob at a larger group of people],
Something Smells,Patrick, You look at it!
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Hi.
Something Smells,[The fish run off.],
Something Smells,Patrick, [points SpongeBob at the whole audience] Look at it! [the entire room empties out] Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!
Something Smells,[Everybody screams in terror and they all run out of the theater in a panic. Patrick and SpongeBob are all alone in the theater],
Something Smells,SpongeBob," They all ran away, Patrick."
Something Smells,Patrick, I bet there's no line at the snack bar. [cut to the snack bar. Patrick leans over the counter] Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.
Something Smells,[Patrick looks bummed out],
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered. [he reaches in his pocket and pulls out some of his sundae] I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!"
Something Smells,"[The fume of it floats past Patrick, burning off his eyebrows]",
Something Smells,Patrick," That looks great! [closes his mouth on SpongeBob's hand, and sucks out the sundae. Patrick sighs with relief, but he starts to feel funny, His stomach makes engine spluttering noises] Oh, I gotta go to the restroom! [he runs off. Cut to the bathroom, where Patrick and Martin their hands at the sink] I'm out of soap, can I borrow-"
Something Smells,, [the stench reaches the guy]
Something Smells,Martin, Stay back!
Something Smells,Patrick, I just want some-
Something Smells,[Martin takes out some money],
Something Smells,Martin, Here! Here's my money! [he drops it] Take it! Take it and go away!
Something Smells,[Martin runs off],
Something Smells,Patrick," My hands aren't that dirty... [he walks over to a line of three fish waiting at a stall] Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?"
Something Smells,[Patrick's breath reaches the fish and they make disgusted noises.],
Something Smells,Indignant Fish, You tryin' to kill us?!
Something Smells,[The fish walk out murmuring. Patrick looks in the mirror.],
Something Smells,Patrick, [In shock] Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
Something Smells,[SpongeBob walks in],
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Patrick, is everything okay in here? [he hears Patrick sobbing. He opens a stall door and sees Patrick sitting on the toilet with a bag over his head] What are you doing in there, Patrick?"
Something Smells,Patrick, Wouldn't you like to know?
Something Smells,SpongeBob, And why is that bag on your head?
Something Smells,Patrick," Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly! [he whips the bag off. SpongeBob recoils and gasps. Patrick walks out] What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!"
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
Something Smells,Patrick," That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me! [his breath reaches SpongeBob and he holds his nose in disgust] I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do."
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Patrick...?
Something Smells,Patrick, What's my mom gonna say?
Something Smells,SpongeBob, [plugging his nose] Patrick?
Something Smells,Patrick," Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but... [SpongeBob screams at Patrick]"
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. [Patrick sighs with relief, his stench in the shape of a skull and crossbones]"
Something Smells,Patrick," Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief..."
Something Smells,SpongeBob," [his eyes water from the foul smell] Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!"
Something Smells,Patrick," Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza..."
Something Smells,SpongeBob," No, I mean just this morning."
Something Smells,Patrick," Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza..."
Something Smells,SpongeBob, What else?
Something Smells,Patrick," Well, I had some of your sundae."
Something Smells,SpongeBob, Sundae... [he whips what's remaining of it out] Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
Something Smells,Patrick, Whatcha mean? [SpongeBob coughs as Patrick's breath flies by him]
Something Smells,SpongeBob," I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!"
Something Smells,Patrick, Stink? [the two cheer and run around in circles chanting]
Something Smells,Both, We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!
Something Smells,"[The fumes encompass the entire theater and it dissolves to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick run out and run up to Squidward, who is looking through the window of a wig shop]",
Something Smells,SpongeBob," Oh, guess what, Squidward?"
Something Smells,Both," We stink! [the two hug Squidward, and then run off, still cheering] We're smelly! I reek! Smell me! [the two run off until they're out of sight]"
Bossy Boots,"[At the Krusty Krab, Squidward is at the ordering boat and SpongeBob looking out from the ordering window. Mr. Krabs' voice sounds on the P.A]",
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention! [Mr. Krabs is standing next to them, speaking into a megaphone] Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office! [pause] That will be all. [Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office and sit down] I have an important announcement to make."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, Woo! Hooray! [SpongeBob jumps up on top of the chair and twirls it around] The new spatulas are here!
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs,"  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulas!"
Bossy Boots,Squidward, [sarcastically] How disappointing.
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast. [he looks at a picture of Pearl and Mr. Krabs in swim attire jumping up from the water] It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh... [puts the picture back on the wall] Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers! [a bell rings]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl, [off-screen] Hello? Daddy?
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, Thar she blows! [Mr. Krabs leaves the room]
Bossy Boots,Squidward," SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, No new spatulas?
Bossy Boots,Squidward," No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, Right! [SpongeBob and Squidward shake hands]
Bossy Boots,Squidward," So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," [Mr. Krabs' head pokes into the office] All right, men. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out of the office] Say hello to me Pearl."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Hello, pole. [SpongeBob hugs one of the giant pillars]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl, [holding a box] Hi guys.
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Great dad, because I have so many new ideas."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, [Mr. Krabs sniffs the air and his eyes conjoin to make a dollar sign shape] I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me! [walks off]
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, What's in the box?
Bossy Boots,Pearl, It's a surprise.
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, I like surprises.
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Great, then close your eyes."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, [SpongeBob covers his eyes with his hands] I'm ready! [Pearl puts the box's open end over SpongeBob]
Bossy Boots,Squidward," Well, I like it so far."
Bossy Boots,Pearl, [Pearl lifts up the box] Ta-daaaaaaaaaaa... [Squidward gasps. The body suit is pink with purple flowers and on the top are two K's being held up by springs] It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself. [Pearl hands SpongeBob a mirror]
Bossy Boots,Squidward," Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Okay, Squidward. [he winks to him] Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!"
Bossy Boots,Squidward, Fish paste.
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Oh SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Sorry Pearl, but this item's not on the menu! [giggles]"
Bossy Boots,Squidward," Well, I didn't think it was possible SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual."
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you too. [she holds up his uniform]"
Bossy Boots,Squidward," Don't bother, only a fool would wear that."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," [Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office, wearing the uniform] Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers? [laughs, then shuts the door. Krabs peeks his head out] Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for."
Bossy Boots,Squidward, [with the uniform on. The two springs give and the K's fall over Squid's eyes] Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
Bossy Boots,Pearl, Squidward is such a barnacle.
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, A stick in the sand.
Bossy Boots,Pearl," But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, Me? Really?
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. [he looks at a picture he drew of Mr. Krabs, himself and Squidward with mustaches]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess, [cut to a view of the Krusty Krab as a deserted place, where a skeleton is sitting at a table] we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise."
Bossy Boots,Pearl," [cut to Pearl with a notepad, thinking] SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?"
Bossy Boots,Squidward," [Squidward runs over] For what, dare I ask?"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Our new name for our new look. I mean, ""The Krusty Krab"" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh! [she points the pencil towards her open mouth, to show disgust]"
Bossy Boots,Squidward," Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, I got it! How about The Kayate Krab?
Bossy Boots,Pearl, Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab? [puckers up lips and makes kissing noises]
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, [SpongeBob is now in royal attire] The King Krab?
Bossy Boots,Pearl," [Pearl holds up a lollipop, which bears an odd resemblance to her father] The Kandy Krab!"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, [SpongeBob dressed as a jazzy beatnik] The Kool Krab. [dresses as a cowboy riding a stick horse] Or the Kowboy Krab! [appears totally stretched out] The Kurly Krab. [appears as a mad scientist holding a brain with Mr. Krabs-like arms coming from it] The Kreepy Krab. [Appears as a crazy killer jungle man with a loincloth. Shouts scarily.] The Killer Krab!
Bossy Boots,Pearl, [freaked out] Aaah! No!
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," You're right, too scary. [they both think and finally get the name and hug]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob and Pearl," The Kuddly Krab! [Both happily hug and laugh. A rainbow of colors fills the screen. Pearl, SpongeBob and an anguished Squidward stand outside the new restaurant. The sign for the restaurant is now a heart and a cutesy robot Krabs is waving his arms atop it. The restaurant outside itself is tie-dyed with colors and rainbows and the flags are now hearts. Balloons are hanging from the roof and giant lollipops come from the chimney. Pearl and SpongeBob, giggling, walk back in the restaurant. Squid is so mad that the two K's on his uniform catch on fire and he shakes the pole. Millie and Fred drive by in a car]"
Bossy Boots,Millie, It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.
Bossy Boots,Fred," That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?"
Bossy Boots,Squidward," That's it! I quit! [he rips off his uniform, revealing nothing under it. A police whistle is blown and a cop comes over. He writes him a ticket and places it between his legs. Inside the restaurant, it's a total makeover, like Pearl said before, it's a teenage paradise]"
Bossy Boots,Shelia," Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out! [Pearl and SpongeBob marvel at their makeover]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl."
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision. [blinks bashfully]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Well, hip people have to eat too. Back to the grill. [SpongeBob is in the kitchen at the grill] The customers may be hot but my grill is hotter. [he pushes his spatula on the grill and imitates a sizzle]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," [Pearl is in the ordering window to hand SpongeBob an order] SpongeBob, order up!"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a [pronounces it wrong] sa-lad? [cut to SpongeBob walking up to Pearl with a tray with two Krabby Patties] Here you go. Two sa-lads.
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
Bossy Boots,Pearl, Exactly.
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," All right. [walks back to the kitchen and sadly removes the top bun] Okay, no buns. That's hip. [removes the bottom bun] No patties [removes the patty] happenin.' [crushed] Oh yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw."
Bossy Boots,Nazz, This is so cool!
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob walks over with a tray of salads to Nazz and Nancy at a table, who are talking] Two salads. [he drops the tray on the table and walks back to the kitchen] That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. [he screams, noticing the grill is gone] Where's the grill?"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Come on SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, Uh... right on.
Bossy Boots,Pearl, Check out this new menu I came up with. [SpongeBob takes the menu]
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, [reading it] Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore. [takes the spatula from SpongeBob. He starts to stutter] I've got something more fun for you to do anyway. [cut to SpongeBob outside the restaurant in a crab suit, waving at cars. One car with Gus stops]"
Bossy Boots,Gus," Hey buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention! [laughs and drives off]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! [he walks toward the restaurant, but gravity gets the best of him and he falls over. He struggles to get up and starts to whimper. Cut to Sponge at Mr. Krabs' door, outside the costume] Okay SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... [he knocks on the door and peeks in] Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? [Mr. Krabs' office is just as elaborately decorated as the rest of the restaurant]"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," Come on in, me boy! Have a seat."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he sits down in a bear bean bag chair, but starts to sink inside it]"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob has sunk in, now you can only see his eye] Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob has totally sunk into the chair and he sticks out his hand] Sure Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," How about my cuddly executive buddy? [picks up a blue stress-relief doll] Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. [Krabs squeezes it and its eyes, nose and ears pop out]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob pops out of the chair] Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! [he covers his mouth]"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab. [goes over to a picture of a seahorse] What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers? [goes to a strand of lights] How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?! [holds one up] It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money! [starts to cry] Oh you're right SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," There there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, That's it boy!
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, What's it?
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, You could fire her! It's ok if she hates you.
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," That's not what I said, sir. [Mr. Krabs brings SpongeBob to the door]"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," Great then, it's all settled you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office. [SpongeBob is pushed out the door and accidentally runs into Pearl]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Totally rude, SpongeBob."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Sure, SpongeBob. [they walk to the kitchen]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [thinking] How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. [SpongeBob opens his mouth to say it, but Pearl is already crying]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," [crying] Oh, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob lets out a sigh of some relief]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl, I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," No, don't you get it! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh SpongeBob, what should I do?"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob thinks for a second] I got it! I can pretend to [air quotes] ""fire you."" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later."
Bossy Boots,Pearl," [Pearl grabs SpongeBob in a bone-snapping hug] Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, [muffled] Stop trying to break me in half?
Bossy Boots,Pearl," [Pearl drops him] Deal. [cut to SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to Mr. Krabs' door, Pearl tries to conceal her laughing] Oh, boy! ,"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing. [loud and clear] Pearl I need to have a word with you! [we see Mr. Krabs in his office sobbing]"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that..."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," [Mr. Krabs is pushed against the door] Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way? [he sees himself in the uniform in the mirror] It's for the best."
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if..."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," I can't let him do this! [he goes for the door, then sees the vault open. It's empty, and a spider crawls around its web] Get on with it, SpongeBob!"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Pearl, you're fired. [Mr. Krabs chokes and falls over]"
Bossy Boots,Pearl," Thanks, SpongeBob. [kisses him. She runs off and jumps into a car with all her friends] Come on gang, the mall awaits! [they drive off. SpongeBob runs into the office]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! [he screams when he sees Mr. Krabs' body. He runs over to a bill behind glass, which is for emergency purposes and he breaks the glass. He waves the bill under Krabs' nose]"
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," [regaining consciousness] Oh Pearly... [sniffs] Is that a 20? [he pockets the bill] Oh SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? [cries]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy."
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs, Really?
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob, She's off to bigger and better things.
Bossy Boots,Mr. Krabs," That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man! [laughs] But how am I going to get my money back for all this stuff? [SpongeBob thinks. Cut to his house, where all the stuff is put up in his house. SpongeBob dances in his uniform to the music]"
Bossy Boots,SpongeBob," [laughing] Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!"
Bossy Boots,Gary, [Gary is covered in stuffed animals and his shell has flowers painted on it] Meow?
Big Pink Loser,Narrator," Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. [chuckles] Well, you know. [Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [arrow on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary."
Big Pink Loser,Gary, Meow.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor. Gary flies away]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," That's great, Patrick. What's it for?"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, See for yourself.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," [his body is facedown but his face come out and reads the award] ""For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement SpongeBob SquarePants?"""
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Ice cream!
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Exactly!
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, I can find it. Is it in here?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, I want an award. [starts to cry]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob with two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry.[Patrick starts sobbing loudly going away from the awards]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, You'll get an award one day.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, I'm never gonna get an award because I haven't done anything.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Smaller. [shrinks]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Doctor?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Smaller. [shrinks more]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Fireman?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [said in the tiny voice] The smallest you can think of. [shrinks even more]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, A job at the Krusty Krab?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [normal voice] Yeah! [grows to normal size] I do things at work all the time.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Then let's go. [Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?"
Big Pink Loser,Squidward, Guess who just quit? [puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Do I get my award yet?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," You have to work for it, remember?"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Tartar sauce. [SpongeBob flipping patties]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [SpongeBob places the order in the window] Pick up order! [Patrick comes and eats the order]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Do I get my award, now?"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," No, you have to take the tray to the customer."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Ok. [tray gets to table but with no food. Patrick burps]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. [Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Like that?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Nope.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, [spits out food at the customer as he talks] Barnacles!
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Let's try something different.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, All you have to do is answer the phone.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Ai Yai, Captain [phone rings]"
Big Pink Loser,Guy On Phone, Is this the Krusty Krab?
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," No, this is Patrick. [hangs up and starts whistling. phone rings again]"
Big Pink Loser,Girl On Phone, Is this the Krusty Krab?
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," [annoyed] No! this is Patrick! [hangs up and continues to whistle. phone rings, yet again]"
Big Pink Loser,Another Guy On Phone, Is this the Krusty Krab?
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, [infuriated] No! This is Patrick! [puts phone down] I'm not a Krusty Krab.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Huh? Oh, Fishpaste!"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? [hands Patrick a broom]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, What's the point? I can't do anything right.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, You'll do fine. [Patrick sweeps with the top side of the broom instead of the bottom]
Big Pink Loser,Nat, [approaches Patrick] Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? [continues drinking]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Keep trying, Patrick."
Big Pink Loser,Delivery Guy, I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Why can't I do anything right?! [bangs the bottom of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [pushing Patrick] Kitchen!
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," [throws the broom to the floor] I'm never going to get an award, now."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. [gets a jar and opens the lid] Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. [Patrick gets out a pickle] Patrick, that's a pickle."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Yes.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," You need a jar. [picks up a spatula] No. [picks up his pants] No. [picks up SpongeBob] No. Try...this! [gives Patrick a jar] Now take the lid off the jar. [puts the lid in his mouth] Just relax. Lift your hand. [Patrick lifts his hand] Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. [puts his hand on counter] No, the lid. [slides his hand to the corner of the counter] [Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him ""the lid"", Patrick pants due to exhaustion. Few seconds later, Patrick is almost there] Freeze!! [hand is on the side of the jar] Almost there. Now head for the lid. [hand goes lower] Cold. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Ow, it burns!"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Exactly as you do. [takes lid off jar, then starts to cry] Oh, no, I broke it!"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," No, no, Patrick, you did it!"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, I did? [both cheer as Patrick throws the jar into the floor] Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Yeah. Remember when I had my up? And I put it on the lid?
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Oh, yeah."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [laughs] Yeah.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time. [night becomes day in SpongeBob's House then clam crows everyone up] I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. [notices Patrick dressed up like him]"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Good morning, SpongeBob."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops] Huh?"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Well, back to the ol' grind."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Well, back to the ol' grind."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Forget my hat.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Uhh, me, too."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up. Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet. SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all. Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps. SpongeBob glares at him]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob and Patrick," [at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads] Whew! [SpongeBob drops his spatula]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [laughs] Dropped my spatula. [bends down to pick it up]
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Uhh, me, too. [drops spatula and bends down to pick it up. SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on. Then they both put their hands on the grill. Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds] Ow!"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Aha! [shows the fake hand] You're copying me!
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Yes.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Why are you doing that?
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, So I can win an award like you.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Well, it's annoying, so stop it!"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Stop it. [both imitate the others facial expressions]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Say, you're good."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Thanks.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob and Patrick," Ha! Darn. [both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chin] Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickled fish lips!! [both cover their mouth] Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [in his mind] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, [in his mind] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob and Patrick, [screaming]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab] Stop copying me!
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, There's no award for that.
Big Pink Loser,Squidward," [leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him] Well, I guess it's safe to go in, now. [puts hat back on and walks back in]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," [he and Patrick are still running] Patrick, how long are you going to keep this up?"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Until I have as many awards as you.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, We'll see about that!
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," No, we won't."
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, [takes out a jump-rope] I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Me, too. [takes out a jump-rope]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Oh, yeah? I call this one The Slice N' Dice. [crosses arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope] Ha! Not a scratch on me. [body breaks down into pieces]"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Oh, no, you don't! [squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces. Then both hit a hammer on their heads]"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," Not much fun being me, now, huh Patrick?"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you. [SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice. Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground. SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob gets mad and steam comes out of his head]"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, My turn! [runs into the pineapple rock]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," [runs into his house] I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. [pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit] Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, What's so great about being a Big Pink Loser? [SpongeBob's nose pops back out] Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," But, Patrick..."
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Patrick's not here!
Big Pink Loser,Delivery Guy, [stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck] Trophy delivery! [he drives off and Spongebob has a package in his mouth]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, Another trophy?
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," Oh, great! [SpongeBob opens the package] What's it for this time?"
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob, 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.
Big Pink Loser,Patrick! This trophy's for you!,
Big Pink Loser,Patrick, Yay! [puts trophy on head like a hat] Eee! [both rip off their present outfit to reveal their own normal outfits.]
Big Pink Loser,SpongeBob," So, what are you going to do, now?"
Big Pink Loser,Patrick," I'm gonna go protect my title. [jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]"
Big Pink Loser,Narrator," So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock."
Bubble Buddy,Narrator," Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," [jumps out of bed] Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note."
Bubble Buddy,Patrick," [as note] SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Ericcson Day! Yingin-hinga- dinga!"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me. [throws his costume away] Another note.
Bubble Buddy,Sandy," [as note] SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, I don't get it. The water's fine. [scene shows the treedome snowing inside] Hey Squidward! Want to play?
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, [as note] No.
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Are you sure?
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, [as note] Yes.
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy! [lets go of the stick which falls to the ground] Nah... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a pile of rocks] Rock Buddy! Nope... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a sink] Sink Buddy! ""[Sink Buddy drips a little water]"" Almost... [scene cuts to SpongeBob again] I've got it! [dips his bubble wand into bubble soap and blows a human shape-like bubble] Bubble Buddy! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and his bubble pal on the seesaw] This...is...great! [scene cuts to SpongeBob going up to the Krusty Krab with his bubble] I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks in the Krusty Krab but his bubble just floats at the door] Don't be shy, come on! [SpongeBob squeezes the bubble through the doors]"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Hi Squidward!
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," This bubble is your friend? [sees his reflection in Bubble Buddy's face; giggles] Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Oh, I'm not hungry."
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," Well, thanks for stopping by."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, Why would I do that?
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, He's hungry.
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!"
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs," [comes out of the register] What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here. [a criminal is eating a Krabby Patty] At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds."
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, I'm not taking an order for a bubble.
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs," Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe. [goes back to the cash register, then he peeks at Squidward] Even if you quit. [goes back into the cash register again]"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, May I take your order?
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you. [reads the menu] Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just take one of everything. [Mr. Krabs explodes through the cash register]"
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs," One of everything?! Whoopee! [rips off his shirt and applies a tattoo on himself that has a heart and the words ""Bubble Buddy"" through it] I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. [points his eyes to a table in the opposite direction]"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, How about a glass of our finest shampoo? [laughs]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Sounds great! [Squidward walks off and returns with a shampoo bottle with a straw in it]
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," Here's your hair care product, sir."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws. [Squidward bends the straw] Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, Mr. Krabs!
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs, [chews and spits a Krabby Patty for an old lady to eat] Think of the customer.
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," [drinks shampoo] Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, And?
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, We? How about you take these patties and sho...
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs, Mr. Squidward! [walks off with the cart]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch."
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," What, is he allergic to bread, too?"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward..."
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style! [sets a bigger ferris wheel on the table] And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs waves]"
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs," So long, boys! You see Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day."
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. [hands Mr. Krabs a $100 bill made of bubbles]"
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs, What's this?
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, Bubble money. [$100 bill pops. Squidward shows his hand full of bubble change] At least he left a tip! [all the bubbles pop as Mr. Krabs and Squidward get angry. Scene cuts to Goo Lagoon]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Here we are buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. [Scooter runs up to SpongeBob]"
Bubble Buddy,Scooter," Dudes, bury me! [laughs]"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, See what I mean?
Bubble Buddy,Scooter, [buried under the sand] All right!
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get us some cotton candy."
Bubble Buddy,Scooter," Don't just stand there dude, the tide's coming in. [laughs. Water reaches him] Dude?"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, [places Bubble Buddy inside] My friend's in there.
Bubble Buddy,Harold, Congratulations.
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, [goes to the music and he dances along] Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! [everyone looks at their behind and they leave in embarrassment]
Bubble Buddy,Pearl," It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper!"
Bubble Buddy,Grubby Grouper," Later, groupies! [shakes Pearl's hand] Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo!"
Bubble Buddy,Pearl," [looks at her fin which is dirty now] Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again. [SpongeBob walks up with Bubble Buddy]"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Hey Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy! [rubs Bubble Buddy's hands on Pearl's dirty flipper, her flipper is now clean. Pearl sobs. Scene cuts to the port-o-potty] It's his first time on his own."
Bubble Buddy,Harold," Once again, congratulations. [later, the line is longer. Picture scrolls over to where we see a sign that reads '45 minutes from this point']"
Bubble Buddy,Man, Popcorn! Peanuts!
Bubble Buddy,Lou, [sounding desperate] Ice cold drinks!
Bubble Buddy,Harold, [camera stops on Harold and SpongeBob as SpongeBob whistles and Peterson struggles to hold it in. unable to take the wait anymore] Two hours is long enough! That's it! [opens the port-o-potty door to see a bubble]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Hey Bubble Buddy, you're finished! [takes Bubble Buddy away, leaving everybody to glare at them]"
Bubble Buddy,Francis, He kept us waiting for a bubble?
Bubble Buddy,Larry," That's nothing! He called us fat! [along with others, begins crunching on celery stalk]"
Bubble Buddy,Pearl, [crying as she shows her clean flipper] He washed my flipper!
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs, [storming up] He owes me money!
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, [following Mr. Krabs] He made me provide excellent service!
Bubble Buddy,Scooter, [appears with a halo and angel clothing on] Dudes! He made me experience high tide! [floats up towards the surface while laughing]
Bubble Buddy,Tom," He poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses!"
Bubble Buddy,Protesters, He did?
Bubble Buddy,Tom, No... But are we going to wait around until he does?
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs, I say we tip something over! [all yelling]
Bubble Buddy,Lifeguard," Hey, hey, hey! [everyone tips the lifeguard stand]"
Bubble Buddy,Protester, Now what?
Bubble Buddy,Protesters," Get the lifeguard! [they go to the lifeguard, but Squidward stops them]"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems! [holds a needle] Who's with me?
Bubble Buddy,Protesters, [all hold a needle] Pop the bubble! [all yelling]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," [everybody surrounds them] Hey everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?"
Bubble Buddy,Protesters, Yes...
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?"
Bubble Buddy,Protesters, No... [group steps in closer]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
Bubble Buddy,Larry," SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern."
Bubble Buddy,Pearl," No. ""Go"" as in... [blows a bubble gum till it pops]"
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, [screams] Why?
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs, You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, No! I won't let you! blows Bubble Buddy until they begin floating] Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha! Never! [both start to get lower to the ground and the group surrounds them both again] Never...
Bubble Buddy,Squidward," Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!"
Bubble Buddy,Protesters, Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble!
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?"
Bubble Buddy,Mr. Krabs," Oh, Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you!"
Bubble Buddy,Sheldon, Funny Muffler...
Bubble Buddy,Larry, Jerky Pal...
Bubble Buddy,Harold, Boo-boo Keys...
Bubble Buddy,Man, Snake Eyes... [together with Harold] We love you! [burst into tears]
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," So, what do you say?"
Bubble Buddy,Protesters," [look at each other, then they bring out their needles] Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! [throw SpongeBob away]"
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet!
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob," Noo... [Squidward charges his needle towards Bubble Buddy in a slow dramatic manner, while SpongeBob begs them to stop. But then suddenly Bubble Buddy grabs ahold of Squidward's hand before the needle reaches the former]"
Bubble Buddy,Bubble Buddy," Whoa! [all except SpongeBob gasp] Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here."
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, So long. [Bubble Buddy gets into a bubble taxi and it floats away as it drives off]
Bubble Buddy,Bubble Buddy, Happy Leif Ericcson Day!
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, He's... alive?
Bubble Buddy,SpongeBob, Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes! [laughs as everyone walks off muttering and agreeing with Bubble Buddy's departure] Seems like only this morning that I held his bottle. [sniffles] They blow up so fast. [weeps tears of joy while blowing his nose and runs off. A bunch of bubbles pop near Squidward except for one]
Bubble Buddy,Squidward, [thinking bubble is alive like Bubble Buddy] Uh...hi?
Dying for Pie,"[One day, Squidward is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island. He hits one of the notes but realizes it's a sour note and he keeps hitting it. The sound is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell]",
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Order up, Squidward! [Squidward wakes up from his dream while his alarm clock goes off. Cuts to Squidward driving to work. Zooms in on one of his bumper stickers that reads ""Don't Ask Me About My Day."" Squidward blearily looks up from his steering wheel to prepare himself for the day ahead. walks up to the front doors and SpongeBob follows him from inside, smiling. Squidward walks inside]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me? [Squidward walks inside without saying a word] Okay, see you later, Squidinator."
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," Good morning, Mr. Squidward. [Raises his eyebrows; Squidward sticks out his tongue] So, are you ready?"
Dying for Pie,Squidward, To go home?
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards... [points at SpongeBob] ...that guy. [SpongeBob is washing a table with a buffer. He scrubs his face and gets it scrambled. He laughs]"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for you."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift. [holds up a sweater] Ta-dah. [zooms in to show it's a picture of a heart with Squidward's face on it]"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it. [laughs as Squidward has a hard time putting the sweater over his head]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size. [Squidward gets the sweater over his head] Do you love it?"
Dying for Pie,Squidward, [starts scratching the sweater] It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of? [cut to SpongeBob with no eyelashes or eyebrows]
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Eyelashes! [Squidward throws the sweater at SpongeBob, causing him to whimper]"
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs, After you present your brotherhood gift.
Dying for Pie,Squidward, I'll buy the little twerp a gum ball.
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, [walks to the doors] The only thing I'm making is for the exit. [opens up the door to see SpongeBob with a new sweater made out of a clear liquid]
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. [sniffs. Squidward sighs and walks towards the kitchen]"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
Dying for Pie,Captain," Heave-ho! [Squidward looks and sees some pirates outside carrying some pies onto the ship] If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good."
Dying for Pie,Pirate," Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. [holds up money]"
Dying for Pie,Captain," Wait! [jumps down off the ship] We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," So, what flavor is it?"
Dying for Pie,Pirates, [all talking at once] Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back. [Squidward gives the pirate the money. Cut to Squidward placing the pie on Mr. Krabs' desk] Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now."
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right. [about to put a piece in his mouth] Wait a second... this would go great with some milk! [while walking to the milk, he trips over a book and the piece of pie flies into the milk, causing an explosion] So, you tried to kill me over a little new aged management, eh?"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! [cut to inside Mr. Krabs' office]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie! [looks at the card attached to it] It's from Squidward. [reading] ""To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."""
Dying for Pie,Squidward, And that's what happened.
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs, 25 dollars? A bomb?
Dying for Pie,Squidward & Mr. Krabs, [loudly] In the Krusty Krab?! [both run back into the office but the pie is not there]
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs, That's where you left it.
Dying for Pie,Squidward, It's not there.
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Hey guys. [licks his fingers then rubs his belly] Thanks for the pie, Squidward. [sings] La, la, lalalalalala. [skips out]"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs, You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Kill him? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob taking a tray to a customer]
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Here's your order, sir."
Dying for Pie,Customer, Thanks. [SpongeBob explodes and pieces of SpongeBob fly everywhere]
Dying for Pie,Squidward," No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!"
Dying for Pie,Squidward, You've seen this before?
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs, Eleven times as a matter of fact. [Squidward runs over to a phone and dials the hospital]
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times? [hangs up] Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? [both look out the window and see SpongeBob cheerfully wiping off a table, apparently having forgotten about the earlier incident]"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. [walks away]"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," [tears up] You're right, Mr. Krabs! [sobs] I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it. [opens the door then turns around, smiling] Drown in it! [walks out]"
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," [writes on a notepad] Note to self Watch out for Squidward. [Cut to Squidward walking over to SpongeBob, who is singing happily and wiping the table]"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Uh, SpongeBob?"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, [sing-songy] Yes?
Dying for Pie,Squidward," I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Part two? [bounces up and down] Part two, part two, part two, part two... [Squidward grabs him]"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Please, don't do that."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, What's the part two?
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? [SpongeBob takes out a list]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Great. Uh, let me see it. [looks at the list]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," The things that are extra fun, I've written in red."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Everything's in red.
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Yeah, I know."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman] Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids] Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. [one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking up to a fish sitting on a bench] Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Hey, Frank. [montage ends] Glad that's over."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Good, cause we're onto our next activity."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Which is...?
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, I'm going to show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
Dying for Pie,Squidward, You're going to be wearing a salmon suit?
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," [laughs] That's a good one Squidward. [cut to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at Squidward. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list] Next. [SpongeBob and Squidward sit by a rock] Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Who's there?
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, I am! [laughs]
Dying for Pie,Squidward," [laughs weakly] Oh, yeah... [SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," [imitates the beeping of a back up alarm] Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! [continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face."
Dying for Pie,Squidward,  [muffled] I can't breathe. [SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward]
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, Who's the doctor here? [heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs] The last thing on the list is...
Dying for Pie,Squidward, [with a bandage over his heart] Does it involve more dismemberment?
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, Watch the sunset with Squidward.
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Sunset? [thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon]
Dying for Pie,Mr. Krabs," The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and runs off] Okay, see you later."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?"
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Yeah.
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, [a brick wall is shown between the two] ...and this brick wall that you built between us."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Yeah. [laughs nervously]
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob exploding]"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Explosions... I mean, erosion."
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. [Squidward tears up. SpongeBob burps] Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. [smells the aroma] Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? [the sun starts to go down] Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Four... three... two... one... [nothing happens]
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
Dying for Pie,Squidward," Five... four... three... [an explosion is heard from behind the wall] two... [cries] o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. [he sighs] I am such a good person. [another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down on top of Squidward. SpongeBob is blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles]"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Hey, Squidward, check this out! [Squidward gets up and mutters] Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Why are you still here?
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. [holds up a book that says ""Friends 4 Ever""] I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," [slaps book away] Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, You want me to explode?
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Um, okay, I'll try. [grunts and then yells] Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert and you are gonna like it! [laughs] Now it's your turn."
Dying for Pie,Squidward," [yells and stomps on the ground] That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Oh, good one."
Dying for Pie,Squidward, No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! [he flaps his arms]
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, Why would I do that?
Dying for Pie,Squidward, Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob, What pie?
Dying for Pie,Squidward," The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!"
Dying for Pie,SpongeBob," Pie...pie... [takes out a pie] Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! [walks forward and trips on a rock] Oops! [pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion causing an explosion the size of an atomic bomb, which is a clip of test Baker, just offshore from Bikini Island]"
Dying for Pie,Squidward," [now in the destroyed town] Ouch. [fade to black, episode ends]"
Imitation Krabs,Narrator," Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the Krabby Patty, with its top secret formula, known only to those who are brave enough and intelligent enough to comprehend its culinary complexity. [SpongeBob is balancing a spatula on his nose behind the register]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Look Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers."
Imitation Krabs,Narrator," But wherever there's a secret recipe, there is someone who wants to steal it. [Plankton laughs evilly while standing in the head of a robot fish. The head falls down]"
Imitation Krabs,Plankton," Ouch! [robot's arm turns into a mirror] And now for the final touch. [puts on a mustache] Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine. [laughs then wheels himself into the restaurant]"
Imitation Krabs,Fish Robot, Are you SpongeBob SquarePants? [SpongeBob looks in a mirror]
Imitation Krabs,Fish Robot, Then you've just won one million dollars! [SpongeBob gasps] You just have to answer one question. What is the Krabby Patty secret formula? [SpongeBob inhales] Yes? [SpongeBob inhales more] Yes? [SpongeBob inhales even more] Yes?!
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," [speaking rapidly fast] The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary. [SpongeBob smiles, the mustache falls off the robot, then Plankton crashes through the teeth]"
Imitation Krabs,Plankton, [growls] That's it? [jumps on SpongeBob's nose and holds his eyelids] You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, Plankton!
Imitation Krabs,Plankton, [Looks at Mr. Krabs] Krabs!
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, Plankton!
Imitation Krabs,Plankton, Krabs!
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, SpongeBob. [Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton and a straw then puts Plankton in the straw]
Imitation Krabs,Plankton," You can't do this to me, Krabs! [Mr. Krabs blows Plankton back to the Chum Bucket] I went to college! [Plankton crashes into his restaurant] Ouch."
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Don't worry Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square, [grabs himself] and this sponge is Bob, [lifts his arms up] I will not let you down!"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Uh, SpongeBob? [shown holding Mr. Krabs] Could you let me down? [cut to later, at the Krusty Krab]"
Imitation Krabs,Fish," Man, these patties sure are delicious. I wonder what's in that secret formula. [siren goes off. SpongeBob slides down the pole from the crow's nest]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Code twelve, code twelve! [SpongeBob bounces off a trampoline and grabs the customer's head] Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton! [pulls the head off to reveal a smaller head on the customer; everyone gasps]"
Imitation Krabs,Fish, Everyone at the head enhancement clinic said nobody would notice. [runs off crying]
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Sorry Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula."
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy! Just remember the most important rule."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, No free napkins?
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," No, the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," As long as you do that, the secret is safe."
Imitation Krabs,Squidward," I always thought the most important rule was ""why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?"" [laughs]"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?"
Imitation Krabs,Squidward, Huh? [cut to Mr. Krabs and Squidward in a storage room]
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for."
Imitation Krabs,Squidward," Aye aye, captain. [Mr. Krabs leaves. When Squidward walks over to the stock, glowing eyes appear] Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties."
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, [mechanical voice] Mr. Squidward...
Imitation Krabs,Squidward," What now, Mr. Krabs?"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," That's right, I am Krabs."
Imitation Krabs,Plankton," Your boss, your ruler, your master! [laughs evilly]"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Ha, ha, ha. [exhaust smoke spurts out]"
Imitation Krabs,Squidward, You're not Mr. Krabs.
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Hey, why don't you take the rest of the day off?"
Imitation Krabs,Squidward," [chuckles and runs to the door] Well... whatever you say, ""Mr. Krabs."" [laughs] Whoopee! [runs out as SpongeBob walks in]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
Imitation Krabs,Plankton," Oh, sweet domination. This is it!"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good. [touches his body] Ooh, you're so cold. [knocks on his pants]"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, That's just my metal suit. I made it to protect the formula.
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [second ""SpongeBob!"" echos]"
Imitation Krabs,Plankton, It's that thick-headed Krabs! He'll ruin everything!
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Look, a jellyfish. [SpongeBob takes out his net and runs around]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," I got it, I got it! [Plankton presses the ""Abort"" button. When he does, Imitation Krabs shrinks into a toaster] I got it, I got it! [Mr. Krabs enters]"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob! [SpongeBob stops and looks at the toaster, which releases its toast, then looks at Mr. Krabs]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," [knocks on Mr. Krabs' pants] Hey Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, You gave him the day off.
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," [pupils get smaller] Day... [bellows] Off?! [Mr. Krabs is so mad that he makes steam come out of the chimney] I don't know the meaning of them horrible words!! Now quit your laying around SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash. [exits]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [puts a clothespin on his nose is going to take the trash out but Imitation Krabs stops him] Hey Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage."
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Never mind that. I need to talk to you. [takes the trash bag and vaporizes it with his laser eyes]
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs! I didn't know you had heat vision!"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Never mind. I need you to tell me...
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob!
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Yoinks! [runs off]
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around. [gives him a spatula] Get back to the kitchen!"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, Yes... why aren't you working harder?
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," [slowly] I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. [both walk out]"
Imitation Krabs,Plankton," I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day. [holds up a penny] It looks like an ordinary penny... because it is an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty. [laughs evilly. The penny pops out of the nose and rolls around into Mr. Krabs' office]"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of... [sees the penny] money! [squeals] Hey, where you going, beautiful? [SpongeBob knocks on Mr. Krabs' door]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs... [the penny slides out of the office] Wha... [Mr. Krabs busts down the door on top of SpongeBob]
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, Stop! Please! [the penny slides between the crack of the doors and rolls away with Mr. Krabs running after it] Wait! [Robot Krabs is hiding behind the sign pole]
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Nothing stands between me and that secret formula now. [snaps off some of the Krusty Krab sign pole. As he laughs evilly, the sign falls on top of him] Ouch! [cut to SpongeBob, who is scrubbing the floor]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub. [Robot Mr. Krabs rolls by] Hey Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'."
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Hello SpongeBob, it is me, Mr. Krabs. [exhaust pipe smokes] In the flesh. [exhaust pipe smokes again] Standing right in front of you. [pipe smokes again] With no one else around."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," I can see that, Mr. Krabs."
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, I thought we might discuss the Krabby Patty secret formula. [a microphone comes out of Imitation Krabs]
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, Isn't that a microphone?
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," What? Why, yes it is. [puts microphone back inside his body] I must get this shirt cleaned. Alright, now tell me the secret formula."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," But sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet."
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Oh yes. Here, let's shake."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," [chuckles] We don't shake with our hands, remember?"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Uh, right, why don't you start?"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, We stand on one foot. [they do] Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem. [they do]
Imitation Krabs,Music," ""Bikini Bottom National Anthem"""
Imitation Krabs,"Oh, Bikini Bottom, we pledge our hearts to you, As faithful, as deep, as true, as blue, Bikini Bottom, we love you!",
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Formula time?
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, Almost.
Imitation Krabs,Narrator," Six and a half hours later... [Plankton grunts frantically as he gets Robot Krabs into a cannon which spits him out, through a flame ring, and onto a chair at a table. He opens up the robot's belt buckle and dumps some spaghetti in there]"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Yum yum, this spaghetti sure is good. Belch!"
Imitation Krabs,Music," ""The Spaghetti Song"""
Imitation Krabs,Meatball. Meatball. Spaghetti underneath. Ravioli. Ravioli. Great Barrier Reef! [They clap],
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Okay, now let's hear that formula."
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Sorry, [takes off his chef mustache] no can do, Mr. Krabs. [Robot Krabs' eyes are on fire]"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, What?!
Imitation Krabs,Plankton, [exploding in rage] But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Now why can't you tell me the formula?!
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle. [holds up a bottle with a piece of paper in it]
Imitation Krabs,Plankton," [Imitation Krabs opens its eyes, Plankton is overly excited and tense] This is it, Plankton. Gently, now... [pushes on a lever that makes Robot Krabs' arm stretch out more. A penny rolls through the door and Mr. Krabs comes in. Everyone gasps, including the guy on the penny]"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, [Gasps]
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, [Gasps]
Imitation Krabs,Guy on the Penny, [Gasps]
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Gasp!
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli."
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs."
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot. [exhaust pipe smokes]
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Who are you calling steam-driven...?
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," [unable to handle the pressure, explodes in frustration] Quiet! [SpongeBob is holding a giant hose in his hands and his eyes bloodshot] Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves, [it is soon revealed that the hose is attached to a large tartar sauce machine] nobody gets hurt."
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs & Robot Krabs, Tartar sauce?!
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Take it easy with that thing, son. [SpongeBob squirts some tartar sauce at Mr. Krabs causing him to jump into Robot Krabs' arms]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, Okay then.
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, First question What time does the Krusty Krab open?
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, 930 A.M.
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Right. [to Mr. Krabs] That's one strike, Mr. Fake."
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, But...
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two How much does a Krabby Patty cost?"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, $2.99!
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, On Wednesday...
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass? [Mr. Krabs is shot out of the Krusty Krab with tartar sauce into a fry basket] Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance. [Rolls away in the basket] No!"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye! [walks back inside] I knew it was you all along Mr. Krabs, here you go. [holds up the formula bottle]"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs," Thank you, SpongeDupe. [grabs bottle and laughs mechanically. SpongeBob sees a penny on the ground]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny. [puts the penny inside a slot on Robot Krabs that is labeled ""Self-Destruct 1 cent""]"
Imitation Krabs,Imitation Krabs, Yoinks.
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, This must be your lucky day. [laughs]
Imitation Krabs,Karen, The self-destruct coin slot has been activated. Ten seconds 'till detonation.
Imitation Krabs,Plankton, Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Help! [screams as he wheels back to the Chum Bucket but explodes when he gets inside. giant hand comes down on top of him] Ouch. [the formula bottle rolls back to SpongeBob]
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs, Help! Get Away! No!
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs! [runs to Mr. Krabs, who is still in the fry basket]"
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Back you Hungry Hand, back! Help! [SpongeBob wheels Mr. Krabs back to the Krusty Krab safely]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob," Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony."
Imitation Krabs,Mr. Krabs," Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again. [takes the bottle] However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck. [both laugh]"
Imitation Krabs,SpongeBob, Really?
Wormy,Narrator," Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her. [inside the dome are a few animals in cages and/or jars]"
Wormy,Patrick, Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them? [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a bird cage]
Wormy,Narrator, Perhaps she should have asked someone else. [Patrick whistles at the bird]
Wormy,SpongeBob," Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird."
Wormy,Patrick," No, that's Italian, SpongeBob. [Sandy puts a big sack down]"
Wormy,Sandy," Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day."
Wormy,SpongeBob, This whole sack?
Wormy,Sandy," No, just a cup's worth. [all walk over to a cricket] This here's my cricket. [the cricket makes noises] He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?"
Wormy,SpongeBob," Sorry, but I don't speak Italian."
Wormy,Sandy, And this here's Snakey. [holds up the snake that has a mouse in it's belly]
Wormy,SpongeBob, What's that lump in its belly?
Wormy,Sandy," Well, that's his dinner. [SpongeBob pokes it, mouse moves] Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go. [walks off with a suitcase] See you guys in a couple of days."
Wormy,SpongeBob and Patrick," Bye, Sandy! [notices the worm in a jar]"
Wormy,SpongeBob, ['gasps] Wait! You forgot about this pet!
Wormy,Sandy," Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much. [walks out]"
Wormy,SpongeBob," Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella."
Wormy,Patrick," Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo."
Wormy,SpongeBob," Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play. [cut to SpongeBob playing hide-n-seek and counting] 998... 999... 1000. Ready or not, here I come! [turns around and takes the table cover off of Patrick's head]"
Wormy,Patrick," You found me! [both look for Wormy, who is on a leaf]"
Wormy,SpongeBob and Patrick, There you are! [cuts to Sponge and Pat hiding behind a tree. Wormy pops up behind it] He found us! [they laugh]
Wormy,Patrick," Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever."
Wormy,SpongeBob," I know Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy. [puts a 'Best Friend' ribbon on Wormy] Our new best friend. [puts Wormy back in his jar] Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy, we'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun."
Wormy,Patrick," Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy. [Patrick cries as they both walk off]"
Wormy,SpongeBob," Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow."
Wormy,[day turns into night. Ominous music plays as Wormy makes a cocoon and turns into a butterfly. Cut to dawn when SpongeBob wakes up],
Wormy,Here I come Wormy! [Patrick pokes his head out of SpongeBob's alarm clock],
Wormy,Patrick, Me too! [both run off to Sandy's with their water helmets already on] And then we're gonna play tag and then we're gonna color and then we're gonna build a house of cards!
Wormy,SpongeBob and Patrick," We're back, Wormy! Wormy, Wormy! [holds up the jar with the butterfly]"
Wormy,Patrick, Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?
Wormy,SpongeBob, He's gotta be in here. [opens up the jar. The butterfly flies out onto SpongeBob's jar] I think something bad happened to Wormy. [the best friend ribbon is still in the jar]
Wormy,Patrick," He left his ""Best Friend"" ribbon behind! [the butterfly flies onto SpongeBob's helmet. Cut to a close-up on butterfly. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run behind a table]"
Wormy,Patrick, What is that thing?
Wormy,SpongeBob," I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!"
Wormy,Patrick, [In tears] Why does this keep happening to me?!
Wormy,SpongeBob," Quick, Patrick! We need to make a run for the door! [They start to run to the exit but the butterfly flies on the door] Noo! Patrick, he's blocking our only exit! [They begin to run backwards to the back of Sandy's tree]"
Wormy,Patrick," Now what? We're trapped in here with that...that--""Best Friend Eater."""
Wormy,SpongeBob," Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember it's two against one. Right Patrick? Patrick? [He sees Patrick gone and the butterfly in flying at him and screams] He's eaten Patrick! [He runs away and jumps in a barrel and we Patrick in it] Patrick, you're alive!"
Wormy,Patrick, I am?
Wormy,SpongeBob," Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!"
Wormy,Patrick," Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets."
Wormy,SpongeBob, No it might eat Sandy! We go to get it out of here!
Wormy,[We see SpongeBob and Patrick hiding behind a Sandy's table and Sandy's phone in a jar to trap the butterfly and the phone begins to ring],
Wormy,Patrick, It's for you! [The butterfly begins to fly by the jar]
Wormy,SpongeBob, It's working. He's gonna answer it... [But instead the butterfly just flew pass the jar and the lid closes]
Wormy,Patrick, Tartar sauce.
Wormy,[Then we see Patrick on a plate with an apple in his mouth],
Wormy,SpongeBob, You look pretty appetizing Patrick. Now just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net. [He walks off and the butterfly begins to fly by and land on Patrick's butt which makes Patrick feel scared]
Wormy,Patrick," [Whimpering, spitting out the apple] SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!"
Wormy,SpongeBob, Hold on Patrick. [He searches through Sandy's trunk for the net.]
Wormy,Patrick," I really don't taste that good, Mr. Monster. [Wormy crawls down Patrick's helmet. Patrick sees the butterfly close-up and runs off. SpongeBob runs by with the net]"
Wormy,SpongeBob," I'm coming, Patrick! [Patrick goes right through the net, tearing it up, and crashing into a tree. SpongeBob sees his broken net as Wormy corners him] No, Mr. Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! No, no, please! Wait a second. [takes out a bottle of bubbles and blows one to get Wormy stuck in one] Yeah! [Wormy flies out of the treedome, still in the bubble. Patrick shuts the door behind Wormy] We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now...[Wormy flies to the Krusty Krab]...heading straight for the Krusty Krab! [both run off] It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance. [both go inside a rock and then appear inside the Krusty Krab in another rock. They gasp as Wormy flies toward Squidward and Mr. Krabs, who are taking pictures]"
Wormy,Squidward, Okay hold still.
Wormy,Patrick, He's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs! [both jump at them]
Wormy,SpongeBob," Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!"
Wormy,Squidward," Say ""money."""
Wormy,Mr. Krabs," ""Money!"" [Squidward takes the picture. It reveals SpongeBob and Patrick jumping on top of Mr. Krabs]"
Wormy,Mr. Krabs," What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!"
Wormy,SpongeBob, We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.
Wormy,Mr. Krabs, Is he a paying customer?
Wormy,SpongeBob," Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!"
Wormy,Patrick, [crying] Just like it ate Wormy!
Wormy,Squidward," Um, Wormy? [SpongeBob and Patrick cry]"
Wormy,SpongeBob, Why? Why? He was so young.
Wormy,Patrick," I'll never forget you, Wormy."
Wormy,Squidward," Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster. [Wormy flies in a bubble] That's the monster?"
Wormy,Patrick," Pretty scary, huh?"
Wormy,SpongeBob, A living nightmare!
Wormy,Squidward," I should have known. [walks away] Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express."
Wormy,Mr. Krabs, Now just 'cause you swabs haven't seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
Wormy,SpongeBob, We tried to warn them. I can't watch. [pushes his eyes into his head]
Wormy,Squidward, Get a load of the scary monster. [laughs] Monster.
Wormy,Mr. Krabs," Aw, it looks harmless."
Wormy,Squidward, It's kinda cute.
Wormy,Mr. Krabs, It reminds me of money.
Wormy,Squidward, Monster. [both laugh until they see the butterfly up-close and personal. Their teeth and eyes fall out and they both run away]
Wormy,SpongeBob, Squidward?
Wormy,Patrick, Mr. Krabs? [SpongeBob screams when he sees their underwear and hat only]
Wormy,SpongeBob," [screams] It ate them! And there it goes! [Wormy flies out of the Krusty Krab] First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs! [has three finger puppets for each person] That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must warn the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The fate of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll."
Wormy,Patrick," Aye-aye, captain. [pushes a lever to make the boat sail out of the Krusty Krab. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the streets]"
Wormy,SpongeBob," Okay, Patrick, now this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity."
Wormy,Patrick, Gotcha.
Wormy,SpongeBob," Run, everybody, run!"
Wormy,Patrick, Monster on the loose!
Wormy,SpongeBob," Monster! [everyone runs away screaming. SpongeBob and Patrick give each other a thumbs up. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick putting up a sign of the butterfly saying ""Beware"" when a crowd of citizens runs by screaming. Wormy flies by and SpongeBob and Patrick hide in the bucket of glue and bounce off. Cut to SpongeBob inflating a balloon but then inhales the air in the balloon so he can float in the sky]"
Wormy,Patrick," [using a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you! [everyone screams and runs away. Cut to SpongeBob waving his arms and pointing at Wormy flying by. The whole town is on fire]"
Wormy,Realistic Fish Head," Attention, attention! This just in! [TV shows a real butterfly] A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom. [a man watching the announcement swallows his eyes and has them appear in his mouth when he screams. He runs through the wall]"
Wormy,SpongeBob," We did it Patrick! We saved the city. [In the background, an explosion went off] Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster."
Wormy,Patrick," About the what? [just then, Wormy flies by. SpongeBob, Patrick, and everyone else runs away from Wormy but they still being chased all over town by the butterfly no matter where they go. Cut to black, then, a bus drops off Sandy]"
Wormy,Sandy," Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody? [Wormy flies by] Oh, hey there Wormy. [puts him in a jar] You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy. [everyone runs up to Sandy] Howdy, SpongeBob."
Wormy,SpongeBob, Sandy caught the monster! [everyone cheers and picks up SpongeBob and Sandy and bring them into town]
Wormy,Sandy," I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often."
Patty Hype,"[Episode starts with the Krusty Krab. We see inside, it is dirty and covered in cobwebs. Squidward is seen covered in dust and cobwebs. He blows himself the dust and webs off and the register. SpongeBob dusts off a cobweb on on of the tables with a feather duster. A spider comes down and makes a new web. SpongeBob dusts it off, but the spider comes back and makes another one. Mr. Krabs is seen covered in dust against the wall. He sneezes the dust off.]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Ah-ah-achoo! [sighs] 36 days without a customer.
Patty Hype,Dave, So...hungry...
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Ah!
Patty Hype,"[Krabs squeals in delight, revealing a spider web growing in his mouth. A spider crawls all over it]",
Patty Hype,Dave, No food... 3 days...
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way! [He is about to call into the kitchen, but then has a second thought] Uhh... You got money, right?"
Patty Hype,Dave, Yeah...
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Here you go, sir."
Patty Hype,Dave," Oh. Krabby Patties, huh?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Finest under the sea!
Patty Hype,Dave," Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs,  Huh?
Patty Hype,Dave," Look at this place. I mean, what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring! [He turns and crawls away] Food! Water! Atmosphere!"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, No one goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. They go for food!
Patty Hype,[He looks out the door as Fred and Tom see each other on the street],
Patty Hype,Fred," Hey, Tom!"
Patty Hype,Tom," Fred! Hey, you wanna eat at the Krusty Krab?"
Patty Hype,Fred," Nah, I'm going to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!"
Patty Hype,Tom," Great! Say, what's a dog?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, [Gasps] Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring customers back in here!
Patty Hype,[SpongeBob peek through Mr. Krabs' eye stalks],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," I have an idea! [Mr. Krabs' eye stalks pull back together, chopping SpongeBob in half]"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Wait! I've got an idea! [Cut to outside the Krusty Krab, where a marching band plays, and a crowd gathers around Mr. Krabs] ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive! [Everyone cheers and confetti shoots up from the ground as Mr. Krabs wields a shovel. He digs a hole, and then hops into it] No free refills. [scene cuts. Then, he pats the dirt in around him, leaving himself underground with no trace of him. Fred runs up to on top of where Krabs was buried]"
Patty Hype,Fred," Hey, everyone, listen! The talking dog at the Shell Shack is singing! Come on!"
Patty Hype,"[He motions for everyone to follow, and they do, leaving Mr. Krabs alone, under the ground. Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab, where it has been cleaned out]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," What am I going to do? If I don't think of an idea, I'll go out of business!"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Why can't someone give me an idea?
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!"
Patty Hype,"[A divine light hits Krabs, and SpongeBob comes down, playing the harp and dressed like a angel]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," [sings] Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
Patty Hype,[Krabs grabs SpongeBob],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? Tell me!"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," OK. Prepare yourself, Mr. Krabs. Don't bother sitting down, Mr. Krabs, because you'll just stand up when you see this! [makes a Pretty Patty] Ta-da!"
Patty Hype,[Shows Mr. Krabs a green Krabby Patty],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
Patty Hype,"[He knocks it off of the plate and onto the ground, where he burns it with a flame thrower. Once the fire is gone, SpongeBob appears in a fire-retardant suit and laughs]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat! [Fire once again overcomes him, and he emerges in regular clothing, with an artist's pallet in hand. On the palette, Krabby Patties lie in different colors] Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors."
Patty Hype,"[Mr. Krabs laughs, and SpongeBob looks broken-heartedly at his own creation]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Mr. Squidward! Come look!
Patty Hype,[Squidward walks up],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Don't that look appetizing?
Patty Hype,Squidward," Mmm, mmm! Good, sir!"
Patty Hype,[Both laughing],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
Patty Hype,[Squidward laughs],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, What's next? Sequin milkshakes?
Patty Hype,[Holds up a milkshake cup with sequins and encrusted into it],
Patty Hype,Squidward, Bow-tie French fries?
Patty Hype,[He holds up a French fry with a bow-tie on],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, [Welding with tears] No...
Patty Hype,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs dance mockingly],
Patty Hype,Squidward," Pretty Patties, Pretty Patties!"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, [Crying] Stop it! [SpongeBob becomes indignant] I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant! [He runs out of the Krusty Krab] You'll see!
Patty Hype,"[Squidward and Mr. Krabs look at each other. Then, they continue laughing. Cut to Conch Street, where SpongeBob passes his and Squidward's house to get to Patrick's house]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too?"
Patty Hype,Patrick, Yeah.
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, What's the matter?
Patty Hype,Patrick, I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so!"
Patty Hype,Patrick," Me too. [He pulls a cord on his own Hawaiian shorts, causing them to inflate and lift into the air a few feet. Patrick is now upside-down] Inflatable pants! What's your idea?"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
Patty Hype,[pants explode],
Patty Hype,Patrick," Forget my dumb idea, that's great!"
Patty Hype,"[Cut to later, where SpongeBob has constructed a purple stand that says ""Pretty Patties"". Patrick is behind a second one to the left of SpongeBob that is brown and says ""Pay Here""]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick? [Patrick pulls up his purple-and-green trunks and gives SpongeBob the thumbs-up] Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open! [He puts up an ""Open"" sign. Cut to him at the stand] I'm ready! [We see him as an adult with the same camera angling. He has glasses on, and brown hair] I'm ready. [We see him as an old man with a long, gray beard. His pineapple wilts and dies] I'm ready... [We see his gravestone behind the stand, that says ""R.I.P. I'M READY"". There is a vacant spot where his pineapple previously was. SpongeBob wakes up at the stand and sees that that was a dream] Patrick, how long have we been standing here?"
Patty Hype,Patrick, [He looks at the sloppily-drawn crayon marks on his wrist made to look like a watch] Awww! I gotta draw a new battery for this.
Patty Hype,[He scribbles on his wrist with a blue crayon],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb.
Patty Hype,[He cries],
Patty Hype,Patrick," SpongeBob, sometimes we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems."
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, I'm scared.
Patty Hype,Patrick, Then I'm going in for you!
Patty Hype,"[He climbs into SpongeBob's head through one of his pores. Then, SpongeBob blows up like a puffer fish]",
Patty Hype,Patrick, Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants!
Patty Hype,[He flies out of SpongeBob],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, Did you find anything?
Patty Hype,Patrick, Huh?
Patty Hype,[Harold walks up to the stand],
Patty Hype,Harold," Hey, do you sell food here?"
Patty Hype,[He is creeped out as SpongeBob and Patrick giggle],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties!"
Patty Hype,[He holds out a green Pretty Patty],
Patty Hype,Harold, That thing's green! [He starts laughing hysterically] Green!
Patty Hype,"[He laughs more. Patrick joins in, but doesn't laugh hard at all.]",
Patty Hype,Patrick, Green. [SpongeBob cries]
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these?
Patty Hype,[He holds out the palette of Pretty Patties],
Patty Hype,Harold," [Stops laughing] Hey, is that one purple? Purple is my favorite color! [He tries it] This ain't half bad! Hey, world! ""Pretty Patties"" is the best idea ever!"
Patty Hype,"[Cut to Mr. Krabs in his office, eating popcorn and watching a movie, crying. A spider dangling from its web cries as well]",
Patty Hype,Rick's Wife," [On TV] Oh, Rick, how could you? Together we were one!"
Patty Hype,Rick," [On TV] That was before. But now, I'm splitting us up."
Patty Hype,"[Onscreen, we see an amoeba split into two amoebas. All of a sudden, it turns to a Bikini Bottom News emergency broadcast. Johnny talks at a desk. Behind him is a bamboo screen showing a crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens cheering]",
Patty Hype,Johnny, We interrupt this program to bring you a special news announcement! This wild crowd behind me is screaming for Bikini Bottom's latest culinary sensation. Let's take a listen.
Patty Hype,All, [Chanting] Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Pretty Patties? [The spider comes down and steal Mr. Krabs' popcorn]
Patty Hype,Johnny," It's easy to see Pretty Patties are popular, but what is it about them that drives Bikini Bottom feeders wild?"
Patty Hype,"Millie, Sadie [has hair], and Evelyn", They match our purses!
Patty Hype,Scottish Man," [With Scottish accent, kilt, and bagpipe] They remind me of home."
Patty Hype,"[He holds up a plaid Pretty Patty, and Larry the Lobster runs up]",
Patty Hype,Larry, Pretty Patties rule!
Patty Hype,[He flexes his muscles],
Patty Hype,Johnny," Mr. SquarePants, how do you explain all this success?"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, Uhhh... I don't know.
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
Patty Hype,Johnny, And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, [laughs] At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it...
Patty Hype,[Mr. Krab's eyestalks inflate],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, ...shredding it...
Patty Hype,[Krabs' eyestalks blow up even more],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, ...and burning it!
Patty Hype,[Mr. Krabs's eyestalks burst and fly around like a balloon with a hole in it as he screams],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," But in the end, we decided just to give it all away."
Patty Hype,"[We see Patrick at this stand that now has a bamboo ""$"" and says ""FREE MONEY"". He hands a filled paper sack to Nathiel]",
Patty Hype,Patrick," Come again, sir!"
Patty Hype,Nathiel, I'm getting back in line!
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, I don't believe it!
Patty Hype,[He runs out of the office and across the dining area],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, I've got to see this for me self!
Patty Hype,[He runs out the door and into Sandals],
Patty Hype,Sandals," Hey! Watch it, buddy. I don't care how much you want your Pretty Patty. You're gonna have to wait in line like the rest of us."
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, I've never had a line.
Patty Hype,"[At SpongeBob's stand, the ""Now Serving"" sign flips to 46,853]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Who's #46,853?"
Patty Hype,[There is an excited roar from the crowd. Mr. Krabs makes his way to the front of the line],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," I never had 46,853 customers."
Patty Hype,[SpongeBob hands a patty to Unknown Anchovy],
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Here you are, sir. Stay pretty. [laughing] All right. Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? The Pretty Patties are a big hit!"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab."
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab."
Patty Hype,[Mr. Krabs gets an idea],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake."
Patty Hype,"[He takes SpongeBob by the hand and starts to walk away, but SpongeBob's arm expands and he just stays in the same place]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye. [SpongeBob retracts his arm]"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, You will?
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," No! I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab. With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!"
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," [In a trance] What did you say, Mr. Krabs?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. She's yours now.
Patty Hype,"[He hands him a key, composed of two golden ""K""'s and a ring]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," Thank you. What should I do now, Mr. Krabs?"
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya."
Patty Hype,SpongeBob," I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs."
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it! Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!"
Patty Hype,"[He tosses SpongeBob to the crowd, who holds him above their hands and passes him down. While crowd-surfing, SpongeBob's surroundings turn into a pink sky with clouds]",
Patty Hype,SpongeBob, Dreams do come true!
Patty Hype,"[The crowd throws him on the ground in front of the Krusty Krab, where he floats up and kisses the building. We see him cheer in the dining area, kiss the floor, throw buns up into the air in the kitchen, laugh over the phone in Mr. Krabs' office, and stand at the ordering boat, the whole Krusty Krab cleaned and refreshed. Cut back to the Pretty Patties stand, where Mr. Krabs holds up a patty]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," Ladies and gentlemen! ""Pretty Patties"" is now under new management! Who's next?"
Patty Hype,"[He waves a patty in the air. We see a sea-level shot of the Bikini Atoll Island. It turns from night to dawn. Cut to Mr. Krabs at the stand beside SpongeBob's house. The ""Free Money"" stand has been disassembled]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, I'm ready! I'm ready! For me money. [A crowd gathers around him] Welcome to Pretty Patties! May I take your money?
Patty Hype,Franco," We want a refund, Krabs!"
Patty Hype,[all talking at once],
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, Wha-!?! Who? What?
Patty Hype,Bill, Your dumb Pretty Patties turned my face purple!
Patty Hype,Scottish Man, Look what I got under me kilt!
Patty Hype,"[He raises his kilt to reveal a plaid body, and white underwear.]",
Patty Hype,"Clay, John, and Frank", And look at our tongues!
Patty Hype,"[We see a yellow tongue, a speckled tongue, and a pink tongue. Krabs refers to Frank's]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs, What's wrong with you?
Patty Hype,"[Frank turns off a light to reveal his tongue is glow-in-the-dark, and is pulsing green]",
Patty Hype,Frank," We want our money back. All 46,853 of us."
Patty Hype,"[He turns the light back on, but Krabs is nowhere to be seen]",
Patty Hype,Harold," Hey, where'd he go?"
Patty Hype,"[Cut to Krabs running away, and the crowd chasing them, a rainbow trailing behind them. Mr. Krabs slams into the Krusty Krab door, but it is locked, so he searches for his key]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," My key! Where's my key? [Recalls he gave it to SpongeBob, and presses himself against the door to get SpongeBob's attention]SpongeBob! Let me in! SpongeBob! Let me in! SpongeBob!"
Patty Hype,"[SpongeBob is in the dining area, and cannot hear due to his pickle-squeaking. Krabs is chased left and right by the mob, still yelling. It uses like this Squeak!. Squeak!. Squeak!. crowd muttering angrily]",
Patty Hype,Mr. Krabs," [screams] SpongeBob, let me in! SpongeBob!"
Grandma's Kisses,[SpongeBob is standing on a hill looking at his grandma's house],
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for? [runs down the hill] Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, SpongeBob!
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Hi, Grandma! [hugs her as the two walk into the kitchen]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Come in and sit for a while. [gives SpongeBob a plate of cookies] Have a cookie, SpongeBob!"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea. [grabs a cookie and dips it in a glass of  milk] Oh yeah... [eats it. His eyes turn into cookies] Grandma's cookies..."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Now, who wants to lick the spoon? [SpongeBob raises his hand]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Me, me, me! [cut to Grandma telling SpongeBob a story while he licks the spoon]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, ...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, Tell me another story about when I was a baby. [cuckoo clock strikes three. SpongeBob gasps] Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Hop in my car, I'll drop you off. [cut to Grandma driving up to the Krusty Krab]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Thanks, Grandma! [hops out of the car]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy! [SpongeBob turns around and heads back to Grandma. Squidward is watching from the window]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," I sure did. [Grandma gives him a kiss, leaving a pink print on his forehead of her lips] Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride. [Squidward opens the door for SpongeBob] Thank you, Squidward. [walks inside while whistling to some laughing from everyone] Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today."
Grandma's Kisses,Squidward," I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, Did I do something funny?
Grandma's Kisses,Squidward, Your forehead. [points to the kiss]
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, My forehead is funny?
Grandma's Kisses,Charlie," Hey, hey, Grandma's boy? Kissy-kissy-kissy! [everyone laughs]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma."
Grandma's Kisses,Charlie," No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers! [everyone laughs] And sucks his thumb, and plays with dolls, and, um... [soon, everyone stops laughing] ...wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um... blankie around, and..."
Grandma's Kisses,Customers, All right already!
Grandma's Kisses,Squidward," Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Really? You do, Squidward?"
Grandma's Kisses,Squidward," Yeah, your grandma! [everyone laughs. SpongeBob tries getting the kiss off with his hand and a mop but nothing seems to work. Everyone is still laughing at him]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, Stop it...! [everyone stops] I have been publicly humiliated for the last time! [runs home crying. Fade to SpongeBob's house]
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Me, too."
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick, You're the most adult person I know.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Thanks, Patrick."
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," You're right, Patrick."
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Have I ever not been right? [cut to a picture of SpongeBob on a giant red firecracker, a picture of SpongeBob with a giant funnel in his mouth while Patrick holds a giant pumpkin, and a picture of SpongeBob and Patrick in black speedos while a wolf whistle is heard in the background] You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how."
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest. [SpongeBob obediently puffs out his chest] Now say ""tax exemption."""
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, Tax exemption.
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz. [jazz music plays] Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready! [cut to both walking up on the hill facing Grandma's house] This is it. What are you going to tell Grandma?"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, I'm a grownup.
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," No ifs, ands, or buts about it."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick, And then you get behind her and I'll push.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Patrick, we didn't say that."
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Oh yeah, right."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake. [takes out a suitcase] I've been growing these babies for years. [opens it to reveal sideburns. Both of them take a pair and put them on]
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob & Patrick, Sideburns. [SpongeBob knocks on Grandma's door]
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," [opens door] Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy. [as she is about to kiss him, SpongeBob puts on a helmet to block it]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," [removes his ""Kisses Not Allowed"" helmet off his head] Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop."
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Oh, you are absolutely right."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," I am? I mean, of course I am."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," I am glad you see it my way, grandmother. [puts on a hat]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Well, I'm glad that's settled. [holds out a tray of cookies] But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," [chuckles] Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat... [notices Patrick isn't there] ...rick? [cut to Patrick sitting at the kitchen table]"
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Keep 'em coming, Granny! [scarfs down the cookies as SpongeBob watches from a window]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, So much for no more baby stuff.
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, And don't forget the cookie-eating hat! [puts a red hat with springs attached to yellow smiley faces on top of Patrick's head. They both laugh]
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.[growls in frustration] [knocks on the door. His Grandma opens it]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick. [runs up to Patrick, who still eats his snack] [whispering loudly] Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Cookies? Warm milk? A bib? [points to it, which reads ""I heart Grandma""] Is that a kissy mark on your forehead? We are supposed to be adults! [bangs on the table]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy. [tickles Patrick] Who's the baby?"
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby! [SpongeBob clears his throat] Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, [chuckles] Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you. [takes out a pipe and blows bubbles from it] Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup. [Grandma comes back with more cookies]
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, Here's a fresh batch of cookies.
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," All right! [inhales them] Rewards, huh?"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Well, yeah, there's, eh... [sees Patrick eating cookies with his mouth open] well, let's see, we... [a cookie rolls over to his side] We went over the jazz... [Patrick grabs the cookie and eats it]"
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Oh, Grandma, I'm full. [Grandma sets down another plate of cookies]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," More cookies! [Patrick uses his mouth like a vacuum and eats all the cookies. One of the cookies rolls over by SpongeBob's side. He whistles for a brief second, then checks his wristwatch]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do. [Grandma takes the cookie away]
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral? [gives him the coral]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Oh yeah, uh... great. [takes a couple bites of it] Nutritious."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, Storytime! [Patrick runs to Grandma]
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Oh boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Storytime? [Patrick is sitting on Grandma's lap, ready to hear a story]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun. [SpongeBob walks in] Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book. [drops a giant book on the floor] Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Oh, uh... great. Yeah. [opens the book] Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. [while eating a cookie, Patrick bites his finger leaving a big red bruise]"
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick, [acting like a 2-year old] D'oh! My wittle finger! [sobs]
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Hold still, hold still. [kisses his finger] All better?"
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick, [talking normally] Sorta.... [holds up his other finger] this finger hurts a little bit too. [Grandma kisses his other finger]
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, How about I give you a present?
Grandma's Kisses,Patrick," Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies! [opens up the box to find a sweater but puts it on his head] Alright, another hat."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," No, Patrick, it's a sweater?"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, Huh?
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, With love in every stitch.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," No... [imagines himself in the sweater instead of Patrick. The sweater tears in half] Don't I get a present, Grandma?"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Oh, I almost forgot. [hands him some office supplies] Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind. [cuckoo clock strikes three again] Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob."
Grandma's Kisses,"[Patrick gets the sweater on] I'll bet you'd fancy a nap, huh, Patrick? [Patrick yawns] You still here, SpongeBob?",
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," [puts a blanket over Patrick as he lays on the couch] No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Yep, that is it. Here I go."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, Come again if you get the chance. [SpongeBob opens the door]
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater."
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, Toodleloo.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, I don't know when I'll be back.
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma, I know how busy you are.
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," So, uh... that's it. [Patrick is sleeping]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Shh, he's asleep. [SpongeBob slowly closes the door]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Soo long... [closes the door but then opens it with sad eyes. His sideburns fall off of his head. He starts throwing a big tantrum] I don't wanna grow up! [holds up a giant chocolate chip cookie and snaps it in half in front of his face] I want cookies! [holds up a giant baby bottle with milk inside] and ""milkie""! [wears a sweater] I want a sweater with love in the stitches! [runs around wearing a diaper with a blue pin on it as he's putting powder in the diaper] I wanna wear ""diadies""! [rides in a wagon] I wanna ride in my wagon! [holds his giant teddy bear] I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins! [rides his old rocking horse with a sailor hat on and a lollipop] I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey! [holds up his bruised finger] And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! [SpongeBob cries this instant as he falls on the floor in his front body, slamming his fists on the floor as if a kid was throwing a tantrum. He then rolls like a wheel. Grandma is shocked and sad for him. SpongeBob, sitting, sprays his tears in his mouth. Grandma thinks for a second. He ratchets like a lawn sprinkler, almost spinning around and sprays tears everywhere. He spins even faster and floods the whole house]"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Take it easy, SpongeBob. [picks up the still-crying SpongeBob] SpongeBob. SpongeBob! [SpongeBob starts gasping after each cry. Grandma holds his lips, stopping SpongeBob's crying] You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love."
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob, [sniffles as he starts to feel a bit better] I don't?
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," Of course not. [pulls the plug under the tears to drain it] No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo. [Grandma tickles SpongeBob, then kisses his forehead] And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult. [hands SpongeBob his sideburns and a chocolate chip cookie] Here you go. [SpongeBob puts on his sideburns and eats the cookie]"
Grandma's Kisses,SpongeBob," Thanks, Grandma. [bites the cookie] Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?"
Grandma's Kisses,Grandma," No problem. [she hugs SpongeBob. Outside, Squidward and everyone else are laughing]"
Squidville,[SpongeBob walks up to Patrick with a package in his hand],
Squidville,SpongeBob," Patrick, look. I got my... [he notices Patrick has the same package. He unwraps his to show a reef blower. Patrick unwraps his to show a flower vase. SpongeBob laughs] I'm sorry, Patrick. [he wipes away a tear from his laugh.] It's just for a second I thought... [notices Patrick has the same reef blower as he does]"
Squidville,Patrick," Hey, you got the same reef blower as me! [Patrick blows at SpongeBob] Tag, you're it. [SpongeBob laughs. Both run around tagging each other. Patrick blows away a can while SpongeBob blows away a sand sculpture of himself. Patrick switches the blower to 'suck' and sucks off the lines of SpongeBob's pineapple]"
Squidville,SpongeBob," Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean."
Squidville,Patrick, Sure did.
Squidville,SpongeBob, We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house! [Patrick sucks up the nose on Squidward's house and laughs] My turn. [SpongeBob sucks up one of the windows. Squidward opens up the other window]
Squidville,Squidward, What is going on out here?
Squidville,SpongeBob, We're playing with our new reef blowers!
Squidville,Squidward, Playing with a reef blower? That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of.
Squidville,SpongeBob, But it's fun!
Squidville,Squidward, Fun?! How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?
Squidville,Patrick, Like this... [Patrick sucks the window up. Squidward pulls his nose out of the wall]
Squidville,Squidward," [rubs his nose] Chafed. [opens his front door] Alright, that's...! [Patrick sucks up the door]"
Squidville,SpongeBob," Let's do your house, Patrick."
Squidville,Patrick," Yeah! [the two walk to Patrick's rock, and they see Squidward digging a hole up to the surface, seeing as how he couldn't exit his house any other way. He jumps out of it, fuming]"
Squidville,SpongeBob," Squidward, you're steaming! You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter."
Squidville,Squidward, Put my windows back!
Squidville,Squidward," SpongeBob, this is the final straw. I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it. I would- [he is hit on the head with a rock] I would rather tear out my brain stem, carry it into the middle of the nearest four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than go on living where I do now. [the TV falls to the ground and turns on. On the television is an octopus, who looks like Squidward, but with a hair piece. He is in a suit and stands in front of a rainbow]"
Squidville,TV Octopus," Hi there! Is this the final straw? Do you want to move so far away, that you can brag about it. Would you rather tear out your brain stem, walk out into the middle of the nearest three-way-"
Squidville,Squidward, Four-way!
Squidville,TV Octopus," Four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than continue living where you do now? Then move to- [the screen goes to static, as Patrick has changed the channel with a remote]"
Squidville,Patrick, I hate this channel.
Squidville,Squidward, No! No! [he grabs the remote and changes it back]
Squidville,TV Octopus," -Tentacle Acres! Where happiness is just a suction cup away! [he puts his tentacles together and pops them. The pop echoes. Cut to a large complex, fenced off. There is a golden door, and above it is the sign ""Tentacle Acres."" Squidward walks to the door, with his clarinet and a few other things. He talks into the intercom on the door]"
Squidville,Squidward, Hello?
Squidville,Guard," Yes, can I help you?"
Squidville,Squidward, I'm here about the happiness. I'll be moving in now.
Squidville,Guard, Are you alone?
Squidville,Squidward," No. I mean, yes. There's nobody with me. Yes, peace and quiet."
Squidville,Guard," Are you now, or have you ever been, a sponge?"
Squidville,Squidward, No.
Squidville,Guard, What about a-
Squidville,Squidward," [cuts him off] No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving- [the door begins to rumble and the gates open, revealing an entire town of houses just like Squidward's old one. A rainbow is formed. Squidward is overjoyed and walks in. He sees octopus kids at an ice cream truck] Heaven at last. [he runs into another octopus walking by]"
Squidville,Other Octopus, I've seen more alert people in a retirement home.
Squidville,Squidward," Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late."
Squidville,Other Octopus,"  I've heard better comebacks from a turkey sandwich, get a life! [Squidward squints angrily at him, then becomes happy]"
Squidville,Squidward," This place is even better than I expected! [walks down the road, reading off the house numbers] 302, 303, and 304. Beautiful. [he walks in to house 304] And not a pineapple in sight. [he shuts the door]"
Squidville,"[Cut to night, where Squidward is in cap, nightshirt, and slipper, going to bed. His clarinet, as always, is next to him]",
Squidville,Squidward," Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew."
Squidville,"[the phone rings, startling Squidward. Squidward answers it]",
Squidville,Squidward," 304 New Life street, Squidward speaking. [he hears SpongeBob on the other end speaking gibberish] There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob. I am finally among my own kind. [he hears more garbling] Now goodbye!"
Squidville,"[He hangs up. Back at SpongeBob's place, he and Patrick are crushed and exchange gibberish]",
Squidville,"[The next day, Squidward walks out of his house and breathes in the fresh air]",
Squidville,Squidette," Would you pipe down over there, iron lung? [the two start laughing, their foreheads fluctuating up and down as they do. Squidward sucks up the croquet balls and the man's croquet hammer which he was leaning on. He falls to the ground. Squidward laughs]"
Squidville,Squidward," Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a ""leg"" to stand on! [he continues laughing. The woman helps the octopus up]"
Squidville,Squidette, Hey! That's not funny!
Squidville,Octopus #1," Yeah! [another man walks by, clarinet in hand]"
Squidville,Octopus #2, What's going on over here? [the croquet woman points at Squidward]
Squidville,Squidette, [Points at Squidward] It's that guy! He's playing with a reef blower!
Squidville,Octopus #2, Playing? With a reef blower? That's the most childish thing I've ever heard of!
Squidville,Squidward, But it's fun!
Squidville,Octopus #2, [Octopus #2 laughs] How could you possibly have fun with one of those oversized hair dryers?
Squidville,Squidward," Like this! [Squidward sucks up the man's clarinet, and it gets stuck in the nozzle, playing sour notes. The octopus screams]"
Squidville,Octopus #2," Give it back! Please! [Squidward blows it back at him, lodging it in the middle of his face like a crease. Squidward laughs maniacally and runs off. He approaches an octopus on a bike and sticks the nozzle to the ""wheel""]"
Squidville,Squidward," Tag! You're it! [he blows on it, inflating the octopus's head.]"
Squidville,Squidette," What can I get you boys? [Squidward opens a door on the stand and sucks up the two guys' eyes and noses and blows them back out, but puts two noses on one guy and four eyes on the other guy. He runs off laughing]"
Squidville,Octopus, What are you looking at?
Squidville,Octopus #2," Those. [meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick approach the complex]"
Squidville,SpongeBob," Here it is, Patrick. Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home. You got the apology cake? [Patrick picks up a cake that reads, 'Sorry.' He puts it back in his pants, revealing a giant cake-shaped bulge in them] We're ready!"
Squidville,Patrick, Ying! [SpongeBob pushes the button on the intercom]
Squidville,Guard," Hello, can I help you?"
Squidville,Patrick," Can I get a large #1, extra size?"
Squidville,SpongeBob," But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins. [Patrick opens his mouth, the fumes emerging from it. A foghorn sounds]"
Squidville,Patrick," I love... fried oyster skins. [cut to inside the control room, where the guard sees SpongeBob and Patrick on one of his monitors]"
Squidville,Guard," We're sorry, but your kind isn't allowed here. [a security guard walks up next to him] He's not leaving, Orville. [the fumes enter the room] You got your night stick ready? [the two smell] Fried oyster skins?! [the two collapse, the guard falling on a button opening the gate]"
Squidville,Patrick," I guess we've got to order inside. [meanwhile, a group of octopi are angrily chasing after a happy-go-lucky Squidward. He sucks the noses off of three houses whilst running by. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking by when they see Squidward run past them]"
Squidville,SpongeBob," Hey! That looked like Squidward! [the mob runs past them] That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form! [Squidward has approached a dead end]"
Squidville,Policeman," Hold it right there, Mr. Tentacles!"
Squidville,Squidward, Stand back! I've got gardening tools! [the policeman hands him an envelope]
Squidville,Policeman, Here! Just read this! [Squidward looks at it]
Squidville,Squidward, What is it?
Squidville,Policeman, A well thought out and organized list of complaints! [the mob shouts out in agreement. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]
Squidville,SpongeBob," Patrick, look! It's Squidward! [he runs up to the guy and hugs him, but he's a different octopus with eyebrows and mustache, and a shirt like Squidward's] Squidward! We finally found you! [the octopus pushes SpongeBob off him]"
Squidville,Octopus, Get off me! I'm not Squidward! [pause]
Squidville,Patrick, Are you Squidward now?
Squidville,Policeman," FYI, you don't have to live here, you know! [Squidward, and the crowd, smile]"
Squidville,Squidward," Hey, you're right! [the crowd members' smiles fade] And I'm leaving ASAP! [meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to find Squidward]"
Squidville,SpongeBob, Are you Squidward?
Squidville,Male Octopus, No. [he walks up to the croquet woman]
Squidville,SpongeBob, Are you Squidward?
Squidville,Squidette, No. [Patrick talks to a fire hydrant]

Prehibernation Week,Squidward, How about a break?! We've been at it for days!
Prehibernation Week,Debbie, Think about the children!
Prehibernation Week,Sandy, That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.

Christmas Who?,[At Krusty Krab],
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob, And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.

Christmas Who?,SpongeBob," Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?"
Christmas Who?,Squidward, My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob," Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival."

Christmas Who?,SpongeBob," But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift."
Christmas Who?,Squidward," SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!"
Christmas Who?,Squidward, My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch. [closes door]

Christmas Who?,SpongeBob, Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny."
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob," And what about that nose? [pokes his nose and laughs] I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that things gigantic. [laughs]"
Christmas Who?,Squidward, Alright! I'm Santa.
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob, [glues a jump onto Santa] Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
Christmas Who?,Squidward," I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did."
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob, I did? [faints and falls on Gary's shell]
Christmas Who?,Gary, Meow.
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over."
Christmas Who?,Shelly," Do you have a present for me, Santa?"
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really..."
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob," [laughs] Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down."
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Uhh, right, just a second. [searches in his house for stuff] C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect! [hands the little girl a wrench] There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!"
Christmas Who?,Shelly," Thanks, Santa. [scratches the wrench like it was a puppy]"
Christmas Who?,Squidward, That almost felt good. [Squidward then notices a long line of citizens waiting for presents] I didn't... who?
Christmas Who?,Fred," Hey, Santa, where's my present?"
Christmas Who?,Old Man Jenkins, And mine!
Christmas Who?,Abigail-Marge, And what about me?
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people. [searches for stuff in his house] Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you."
Christmas Who?,Jennifer-Millie," Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted. [puts bowl on her head] A new hairstyle."
Christmas Who?,Squidward,"  [gives the little girl two forks and gives Patrick a clock] Here you go, Patrick."
Christmas Who?,Patrick, Wow. [punches a hole through the clock] A wrist watch.
Christmas Who?,Squidward,  [gets everything else in his house to the citizens] What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane? [SpongeBob knocks on the door] You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
Christmas Who?,SpongeBob," Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind. [turns SpongeBob towards the door and pushes him so he walks] And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward..."
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Well, at least it's over. [notices a bottle with a letter in it on the ground] Huh? What's this?"
Christmas Who?,Santa," Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus. [letter disappears into thin air] Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! [in his sleigh flying] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. [does a crazy dance while saying his ""ho ho ho""]"
Christmas Who?,Squidward," Yup, I'm insane. [plays his wooden clarinet in the ending tone of the episode]"
Christmas Who?,Santa," Merry Christmas! [back at Patchy's house, a sailboat with a homemade Sponge and Pat moves in front of a picture of the island, which has a bunch of presents on it]"
Christmas Who?,Patchy," Dee dee, dee dee dee dee. [in Sponge's voice] Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island! [in Pat's voice] Presents, ahoy! [in Sponge's voice] Hooray! [he starts making storm sound effects] Oh, a storm! [in Pat's voice] Yay! I mean yikes! [he makes more sound effects and begins speaking in his own voice] Oh, we're going down! [He keeps making noises. Zoom out to show the boat is on Patchy's head] Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel! [he screams]"
Christmas Who?,Man on Set, [off-screen] Patchy!
Christmas Who?,Patchy," Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure. [He takes the boat off his head. Potty flies out, and there is a nest was under him, and in it are a few eggs wrapped in bows. Patchy picks one up] Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present. [He laughs. Then he goes over to the mistletoe] Arr, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means. [he sprays breath freshener in his mouth] Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate! [he makes kissing noises] Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain! [He laughs. Potty flies over and squawks. Patchy screams]"
Christmas Who?,Potty, Give us a kiss! [Patchy goes to avoid him]
Christmas Who?,Patchy," No! No, not you! [Potty keeps flying around squawking] No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this! Potty! No!"
Christmas Who?,Potty," Kissy, kissy!"
Christmas Who?,Narrator," Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays."
Christmas Who?,"[the words ""Happy Holidays"" are spelled out on screen]",
Survival of the Idiots,"[SpongeBob and Patrick are running down the block jumping up and down, disfiguring themselves in the process]",
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," [hyperactive, in time with Patrick] Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha..."
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," [hyperactive, in time with SpongeBob] Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha..."
Survival of the Idiots,"[They freeze in mid-run when they see Sandy's treedome is enclosed with metal walls. The two walk up to the door, which has a ""Keep Out"" sign on it]",
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Sandy? [they enter] Hey Sandy, what's with the sign?"
Survival of the Idiots,[the two walk up to a TV which shows Sandy in a pink nightgown eating acorns],
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Look, she's on the Eating Channel."
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," [On TV. Sandy fills her cheeks with acorns and swallows, wincing in pain as the giant mass of acorns passes down her long, thin neck and into her small torso, deforming it as it goes] Howdy! [eats more nuts] If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation. [""HIBERNATION"" appears on the bottom of the screen. Sandy eats more nuts] During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb. [sternly] That means you, SpongeBob."
Survival of the Idiots,[Patrick turns the TV off and puts on SpongeBob's water helmet and his own],
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, We better put these on.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray."
Survival of the Idiots,"[Patrick pushes the button, letting all the water drain out of the front foyer]",
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? ""No"" means ""yes""!"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," SpongeBob, look at this! [snow falls in and covers the bottom of the treedome. SpongeBob gasps and walks in]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, What is this stuff? [pan around the treedome]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before."
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," [teary-eyed] Wow, Pat, that was beautiful!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see? [he hands SpongeBob the wrapper. SpongeBob gasps]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Patrick! Put your helmet back on! [Pat has taken his helmet off and is eating the snowflakes] You know there's no water in Sandy's house!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look! [Patrick lets a flake land on his tongue and it melts into water]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, I guess you're right. It's okay here!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Take it off. No one's looking. [SpongeBob does so and the two cheer and burrow themselves in the snow. They pop back up with noses made of snow. Then, they hear a weird sound] SpongeBob, did you hear that?"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, I think it came from Sandy's tree.
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, That is one tired tree.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Let's check it out. [cut to inside Sandy's tree where SpongeBob and Patrick come in. They both gasp] Look what's in Sandy's bed! [they walk over to the bed, where Sandy is asleep in hibernation form, looking like some weird squirrel-like monster]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, I think this thing is Sandy.
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," [snoring, talking in sleep] I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy... [snores]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," [giggles] She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws. [the two giggle] Look out Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan."
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy, I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Oh, you better run faster, Sandy."
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster! [Sandy moves her arms and legs]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Faster, faster! [the two giggle]"
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics... [snores off to sleep, the two giggle again]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore."
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," That's not disturbing. This is disturbing! [Patrick struggles to create a talking face that protrudes from his back] Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback."
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Ha! That is really disturbing!
Survival of the Idiots,"[the two laugh uncontrollably. Cut to Sandy, her eye shoots open. A giant shadow looms over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick stops laughing while SpongeBob continues to laugh]",
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Uh, SpongeBob?"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," [stops laughing] Huh? [Sandy is really mad now, she's steaming and roaring. Sponge and Pat run, but Sandy has them both by the their underwear and gives them an extreme wedgie. They run in mid-air anyway]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [Crying from the pain of the wedgie.] Sandy! No! Stop!
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," I warned ya, Dirty Dan! Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville!"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Sandy, it's us, your friends! SpongeBob and Patrick!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!"
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy, Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots... [she falls asleep and drops the two. They inch away and see Sandy fall back into her bed]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Fun's over.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her."
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint. [he takes the lint out of its designated area. It somehow forms into the shape of earmuffs]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," All right, Pat! [he takes them and crawls over to the bed. Pat follows. Sponge puts the earmuffs on Sandy]"
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy, I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks? [snores]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Well, that oughta work."
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," [loudly] Hey Sandy, does it work? [Sponge and Pat look at each other and raise their eyebrows repeatedly and in symmetry]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Hey Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up! [the two giggle, Sponge holds a megaphone up to Sandy's head and yells into it]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," See ya later, Sheriff Sandy! [laughs, the two run down to the snowy plains and act like outlaws, with that drawling voice] You're under arrest!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," You'll never catch me! [he giggle and makes a snowball and throws it at SpongeBob's face. They both laugh. Pat starts to make another one, but he's hit by a giant mound of snow. SpongeBob stands on a giant snow cannon] Hey that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons."
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, They couldn't afford station wagons either! [A giant snowball shaped like a station wagon lands on Patrick]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Nice paneling.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! [cut to Pat, who looks like a cone-head]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Who you calling Pinhead? I want to be Dirty Dan!
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, I'm dirty. [he's hit on the head by a giant snow shovel that Sponge has]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, I say I'm Dirty Dan. [Pat runs off and returns with a giant bat with a nail in it made of snow]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, I say I'm Dirty Dan! [whacks SpongeBob with it]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [whacks Patrick again] I say I'm Dirty Dan!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
Survival of the Idiots,"[Inside the tree, Sandy blissfully sleeps until the repeated impacts cause the earmuffs to fall off.]",
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! [Sandy's eyes snap open] [Cut back to outside]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. [SpongeBob sees something behind Patrick and screams in terror] Screaming will get you no- [Sandy reaches out and grabs the top of Patrick's head and rips it off. Sandy huffs and growls as she stands behind Patrick, towering over him with sharpened teeth bared in a snarl]"
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy, [breathing heavily] Which one of you fellers is the real Dirty Dan?!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Uh? I am? [ Bad idea, as Sandy promptly backhands him and sends him flying across the treedome]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Patrick! [Pat slams against the dome hard enough to leave a dent and little drumsticks float around his head]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Hot wings? [cut back to Sandy, who rounds on a cowering and terrified SpongeBob.]"
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours! [SpongeBob's pupils shrink in fear and he screams and legs it seconds before Sandy's fist obliterates where he was just sitting. Sandy throws her head back and bellows] Pinhead! [SpongeBob whimpers and runs, Sandy is close behind. SpongeBob later doesn't seem to be going far because he's right in front of Sandy on the exercise wheel. He slips and gets flung across the wheel. He flies off and slams into the picnic table, leaving a giant crater in its place. Sandy leans over the crater] Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! [SpongeBob picks up a wood board]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Sandy, stay back. I'm warning ya! [Sandy roars right in Sponge's face] Okay, I warned ya! [SpongeBob throws the wooden board, Patrick pops up beside Sandy]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Did you win? [he's hit by the board and rolls down the crater to Sponge's feet] Hi, SpongeBob! [Sandy growls before leaping into the crater. SpongeBob and Patrick cling onto each other in fear for their lives as a huge shadow covers them before a cloud obscures them, presumably simulating a fight. Cut to the treedome at night where two gravestones are in front of Sandy's Treedome one for Dirty Dan and one for Pinhead Larry. Pat and Sponge come up from under the snow in respective tombstone order] Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick!"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! [the two run to the door and SpongeBob tries to open it, but his hands slip off the wheel and accidentally hits Patrick in the face]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Ouch! [covers his eyes in pain]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Let me have a try. [he goes up to the door and spits on both hands, preparing to open the door] Open sesame! [nothing happens, Patrick shrugs] Well, I've done all I can do."
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Then we're stuck in here? until the door thaws? in spring.
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Barnacles. [cut to much later, where Sponge and Pat are completely buried in snow, shivering and blue] Is it spring yet?"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, N-n-n-no. [Pat and Sponge's snow covering on their faces breaks off]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," I'm so cold that I'm shivering! [a piece of Pat's side of his head cracks off, revealing his brain. Sponge snaps off his two nose drippings and clicks them together]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, I'm so cold that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks!
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! [Sponge begins to pull a strip of bark off the tree but he's stopped by Sandy's booming voice]
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," [off-screen] You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! [Sponge quickly puts the strip back on and puts masking-tape on it. Sponge goes back to Pat]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Maybe she just ignores it.
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Maybe?
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, Maybe?
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Maybe it's her fur! [cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob and Patrick, Yeah! [cut to inside the tree where Sponge and Pat marvel at Sandy's fur]
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Look at all that warm, toasty fur!"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," It's like a gold mine, but with fur. [SpongeBob slowly prepares to pluck a hair off Sandy]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Carefully...carefully? [Pat smacks him]
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," All right, all right, hang on a second! [he plucks one hair off and Sandy jumps up from her sleep and roars ferociously. Then goes back to sleep] That should be enough, right? [Pat takes the hair]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Well, I guess I've lived a full life! [he plucks one more hair, causing the same reaction with Sandy]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW! [he takes a piece of masking tape, places it on Sandy]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Pat, no! [Patrick rips a patch of Sandy's fur off with the tape, leaving a patch of bare skin. Sandy roars and goes back to sleep]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Pat, are you crazy?! [we see Pat has placed the fur on his forehead]"
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," No, I'm warm."
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Let me see that roll of tape.
Survival of the Idiots,"[as we pan out from the tree, we hear the tape ripping out Sandy's fur and her roaring. Cut to later, Pat comes out of the tree with a strip of hair on his forehead and his pants full of fur. Sponge comes out with a weird fur hairdo and a goatee]",
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick," Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits. [he lifts his arm up, revealing fur under it]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
Survival of the Idiots,Patrick, You said it!
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!"
Survival of the Idiots,Both, Bring it on!
Survival of the Idiots,"[just then, all the snow stops and melts. It's springtime again, flowers bloom]",
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Spring?
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," [off screen. yawns] Wow, spring already?"
Survival of the Idiots,"[SpongeBob and Pat run frantically to the door, but it hasn't thawed yet]",
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob, Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy, [off-screen] I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!
Survival of the Idiots,[SpongeBob and Pat frantically blow on the door handle until it melts. Sandy peeks out the window],
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," Oh look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!"
Survival of the Idiots,"[with that, SpongeBob and Patrick go crazy trying to open the door. Sandy walks over, completely hairless and in her bikini]",
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," Hey, guys!"
Survival of the Idiots,[She sees all the different fur assortments the two are wearing. She looks down at her bald pink body and screams],
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! [Pat hides his furry forehead piece. Sandy is really ticked now]"
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy,  [growling with fury] SpongeBob... Patrick...
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob," Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered."
Survival of the Idiots,"[He giggles nervously. Cut to Sandy's arm pouring some lemonade, she giggles]",
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy," [giggles] More lemonade, boys? [pan out to see that Patrick is curled around Sandy's head and SpongeBob is curled around Sandy's body, in order to cover up her bald pink hide. The two take a glass]"
Survival of the Idiots,SpongeBob & Patrick," Thanks, Sandy."
Survival of the Idiots,Sandy, Spring sure is lovely.
Dumped,[It's another great day in Bikini Bottom. Gary is out in a clearing and SpongeBob tiptoes over to a rock behind him giggling. He looks from behind it],
Dumped,SpongeBob," Oh, I've got ya now, Gary."
Dumped,Gary, Meow? [SpongeBob jumps up and lands in mid-air. He touches Gary's shell with his index finger]
Dumped,SpongeBob," Tag, you're it! [he runs off, SpongeBob jumps and he opens his mouth. He flies to his house and chomps down on the side of it, leaving him clinging. garbled] Gary will never find me here! [Gary crawls over the ground, up the house and toward SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [Gary's eye substitutes as an arm as he tags SpongeBob and meows] Tag! Now I'm it! [he laughs uncontrollably as he slides down the wall, scraping off two slices of the covering with his teeth. Patrick is below and Sponge takes the shavings out of his teeth]"
Dumped,Patrick," Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Gary and I are playing tag, you wanna join us?"
Dumped,Patrick," Oh boy, would I!"
Dumped,SpongeBob," [slyly] OK, [touches him] Tag, you're it! [walks away]"
Dumped,Patrick," I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it! [Gary is still there, and he meows. Patrick tags him] Tag, you're it! I win, I win! [Gary purrs and rubs against Patrick. Then he crawls all around Patrick's body. SpongeBob walks over] What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat! [laughs]"
Dumped,SpongeBob, That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
Dumped,Patrick, [laughs] It tickles! [the two laugh endlessly as Gary continues to crawl around. They continue laughing and laughing until it's dark]
Dumped,SpongeBob," Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gar-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. [he pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away] Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. [Patrick waves] What about you, Gary? [SpongeBob sees that he's no longer holding Gary] Gary? Gary? [cut to Patrick's house where the rock is up and Patrick's brushing his teeth and looking in a mirror on the side of the wall. He has his nightcap on]"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep."
Dumped,Patrick," Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Hey, that's a great idea!"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover."
Dumped,SpongeBob," OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. [they wave good-bye and SpongeBob walks home]"
Dumped,SpongeBob, I'm awake!
Dumped,Patrick," [off-screen] Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob leaps up and runs to the window. Patrick and Gary are outside]"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Hey guys, how was the sleepover?"
Dumped,Patrick," Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows! [he pulls Gary off his chest and runs. Gary goes after him as he runs around SpongeBob's house. He runs on top of his house and falls off and continues running, which Gary then imitates] See? [SpongeBob jumps from the window and runs off]"
Dumped,Patrick," Come on Gary, let's play a different game. [he and Gary walk away. SpongeBob jumps in front of Gary]"
Dumped,Patrick," Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!"
Dumped,SpongeBob, What's that supposed to mean?
Dumped,Patrick," I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. So I suggest that you put him down and let him choose. [SpongeBob does]"
Dumped,SpongeBob," Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! OK, Gary, go ahead, show him. OK Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary! [Gary turns around to Patrick] Uh, wrong way Gary. [Ignoring, Gary is crawling toward Patrick] G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! [he collapses as Gary crawls up to Patrick]"
Dumped,Lary, [in a deeper voice than Gary's] Meow. [Cut to Lary sitting at a table as SpongeBob walks over with a plate with a cover on it. SpongeBob is in chef garb]
Dumped,Patrick, Hi SpongeBob.
Dumped,SpongeBob," Oh, hello, Patrick."
Dumped,Gary, Meow.
Dumped,SpongeBob," Hello, Gary."
Dumped,Patrick, Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
Dumped,Patrick," And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?"
Dumped,Patrick," I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself. [he takes off his shorts and puts them in the machine; Gary crawls in after them] It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary? [the two notice Gary is in the machine, nudging in Patrick's shorts] He only liked me for my shorts!"
Dumped,SpongeBob," No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! [Gary is indeed eating the cookie. He finishes and crawls out up to SpongeBob]"
Dumped,Gary, Meow.
Dumped,Patrick, Gary? I thought what we had was special...!
No Free Rides,[It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again],
No Free Rides,Narrator," Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means [starts going into a screaming tone] another whole year of boating school! [Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. Narrator groans.]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, What happened?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Oh, nothing SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points."
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, How many does that leave me with?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, Negative 224.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, How many more minutes left in the test?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, The test is over.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," That's enough time, I can make up those points! [Sponge is about to pull into reverse]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! [the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams.] It's too late, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff pleads Sponge to stop as Sponge knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, 6.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, Six.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, [raising arms slowly] Whoo.
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, Hundred. [SpongeBob stops]
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, What?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, 600. You need 600 to pass. You got 6.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [Sponge walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when Sponge crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," [thinking] Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out a teacher's ace in the hole! [starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size] Extra crediiiiit!"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance."
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, What's extra credit?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Now, are we ready for that extra credit?"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, Extra credit!
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school."
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, But I've learned so many things.
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, What's wrong?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, Give me that! Here's a pen.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [SpongeBob finishes] There."
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Fantastic, let me see it."
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. [Sponge jumps on top of his paper]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, Don't look! It's not ready.
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," It's so simple, only 10 words! ""What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, [her eyes grow bulging veins] Blank!"""
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, I can do this! I can do this!
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," I can do this! I can do this! [starts to pant] Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? [screams] My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! [Mrs. Puff jumps on Sponge and forces the pen to push on the paper]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, It's not ready yet.
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," It's OK, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written."
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, No!
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, Give it to me! [the 2 pull on it]
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, No!
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything."
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, Really?
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Besides, here's your license. [gives it to SpongeBob]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," My license! [licks it] It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," [dragging him out the door] Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, Look out Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants. [echoes] SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants. [fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears] La La La La! [he hits many pedestrians] La La La La! [he crashes through Harold and Frank]
No Free Rides,Fish, [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ow!
No Free Rides,[A small birthday party is going on],
No Free Rides,Partygoers," Harris, happy birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg!"
No Free Rides,News Reporter," So much destruction...this reporter asks, ""Why?"" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] Oof!"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, La la la la!
No Free Rides,Reporter, Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality]
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
No Free Rides,"[she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants Family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, ""Thank You, Mrs. Puff! ""]",
No Free Rides,The SquarePants', Surprise!
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, To the greatest teacher ever!
No Free Rides,Mr. SquarePants," Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. SquarePants," I think you made your point, Dear."
No Free Rides,Mr. SquarePants," Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Well, I...Okay."
No Free Rides,Mrs. SquarePants," We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this..."
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, See what?
No Free Rides,Mr. SquarePants," Ta-da! [reading back license plate ""IM-RDY""]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob, A brand new boatmobile?!
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. SquarePants," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins."
No Free Rides,"[In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him]",
No Free Rides,Mr. SquarePants," You took quite a buster there, Son."
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, What I learned in Boating School today is!
No Free Rides,Mr. SquarePants," We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son."
No Free Rides,Mrs. SquarePants," That's right Honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!"
No Free Rides,"[SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat]",
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other and scream. Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal. SpongeBob jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing! [gasp] Oh my gosh, I know who you are!"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am!"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray. [takes it out. He sprays, but it's pointed the wrong way and it gets in his eyes and he screams] Somebody help me! Somebody help me! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him]"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff," Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes. [she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio his eyes are knobs, mouth the speaker, and so on]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob as Radio," And now back to KRUD with all of your personal ""you won't get away with stealing my car!"" hits. [Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on]"
No Free Rides,Cop 1," Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The two policemen scream as they are now scared out of their wits. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling]"
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
No Free Rides,SpongeBob," You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window]. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?"
No Free Rides,Mrs. Puff, What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior]
No Free Rides,SpongeBob, [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,"[SpongeBob and Patrick are at the Jellyfish Convention, where everything is about jellyfish. SpongeBob is wearing a jellyfish hat, Patrick is wearing a net on his head]",
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Wow! We're actually here at the biannual Jellyfish Convention!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick, Jellyfish are awesome!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Cool! State-of-the-art jellyfish nets!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick, [touches one] Touch.
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Guard, Don't touch.
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a giant harpoon with gobs of jelly on it] Wow! The harpoon from ""Jellyfish The Movie!"""
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick, [touches it] Touch.
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Guard, Don't touch!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a crowd, watching a fish with a giant sore on his cheek pointing to a board with a mean jellyfish picture on it] Look! Dr. Manowar! The guy who got stung by Big Lenny and lived!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Dr. Manowar, [Talking in a microphone] And now it only hurts when you touch it. [Pat goes up and touches it. Manowar screams in pain]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick, Touch.
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Guard, Do I have to follow you all day?!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Oh! Patrick, look! Can it be?"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick, Ice cream?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," No, it's the Jellyspotters! [we see a crowd of people around a group of fish and a sea cucumber, obviously the leader. He has glasses and a crown thing coming from his head] Bikini Bottom's premier jellyfish enthusiast club! Ah! And their leader! The coolest jellyfish enthusiast ever! [close up on the cucumber] Kevin the Sea Cucumber!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick, What's so great about a nerdy pickle?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick," SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky. [a guy in a giant jellyfish costume walks by. Pat gasps] Oh my gosh! Jeffrey Jellyfish! Wait, Jeffrey! I have to touch you! [runs after him, followed by the guard yelling. Cut back to the Jellyspotters]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Guard, Hey! [Chases Patrick]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Bamboo? I only use composite materials in my net handle. [the crowd furiously writes notes]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Crowd, [all muttering as they write] Composite materials?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Next question. [the crowd furiously writes notes again]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Crowd, [all muttering again] Next question?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [pops out in front of the crowd, his pupils are huge and he speaks as if in a trance] Hi, Kevin."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Hi. What is your question?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hi, Kevin."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Whatever. Next question, please. [he points to the other side of the crowd, SpongeBob pops up there too]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hi, Kevin."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Hello, loser. All right, you, way in the back."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [pops up in the back] Hi, Kevin."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hi, Kevin. I'm your biggest fan."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, You're too kind. [yells] Security!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," No, wait! I would do anything for you!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Why don't you go jump off a building? [we hear SpongeBob's screams and see him fall from the view through the window. Then SpongeBob appears back in the building]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Anything!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Punch yourself in the face. [SpongeBob does so with a boxing glove. His face is pushed in a bit] Doesn't that hurt you?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [holds up a metal glove with spiked knuckles] Do you want it to hurt me, Kevin? [Kevin and the Jellyspotters all laugh]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, That was the best! [continue laughing] This guy's great! We have got to bring this guy jellyfishing with us!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Anchovy Jellyspotter," No, Kevin, no. He's a geek."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," [whispering] Look, I won't let the guy join the club. I just want to see how many times he can get stung before he goes running home like a baby."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Anchovy Jellyspotter," Meep-meep, Kevin's a genius. [the other anchovies Jellyspotters join in repeatedly saying so]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Hey kid, how would you like to try out for the Jellyspotters?"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, [on a hospital bed. The doctor fish zaps him with the defibrillator and SpongeBob jumps up] I'd love it! [cut to Kevin and the fish supposedly walking through Jellyfish Fields] [off-screen with their legs]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Ah, nothing like driving through Jellyfish Fields with the top down, eh, Jellyspotters? [the Jellyspotters meep in agreement. Pan down to see that SpongeBob is carrying them. He stops]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [breathes out] Uh... here we are, Jellyfish Fields. Ohh... [he collapses. The Jellyspotters get off]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, I hope you didn't forget our nets.
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," I didn't forget them, Kevin. They're in the trunk. [SpongeBob turns around, and the back of his pants opens like a trunk. The group takes the nets and jars out, revealing SpongeBob's buttocks. SpongeBob now has all the nets and jars in his arms] I can't believe I'm actually out here with the Jellyspotters! I mean all my life I wanted to be a Jellyspotter? [SpongeBob starts to vibrate and jump around] and now I'm out here with you guys with the nets and the jars and the jellyfish and I'm with Kevin and Kevin's with me and we're all with each other and we're all jellyfishing and it's fun and-"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Hold it! [Sponge freezes, literally] Before you become a Jellyspotter, you have to pass a rigorous test."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Jellyspotters, [laughing] Meep! Vigorous test! [continuing laughing]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," [To the Jellyspotters] Quiet!, Shh! [To SpongeBob] Your first test catch a jellyfish. [a jellyfish flies into SpongeBob's net]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hey, I caught one! Am I a Jellyspotter now?"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Jellyspotters," Meep, he caught one. [""Meep"" discussions]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Uh, that doesn't count. [he slaps the net and the jellyfish stings him, it flies away.] Ouch! [Kevin grows a giant red sore where he got stung]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Anchovy Jellyspotter, [off-screen in ominous voice] Wha-wha-wha!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, I meant two jellyfish! [two jellyfish fly in SpongeBob's net]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Jellyspotters," Two jellyfish, meep, in the net. [""Meep"" discussions]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, That's not what I meant. I meant 20 jellyfish! [20 jellyfish fly into SpongeBob's net]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," [counting] Oh, Uh, Let's see, one, two, three? [Kevin growls and kicks the net, causing all the jellyfish to sting him.]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Ooh-ooh-ow! Ooh! Ow! [He now has a bunch of sores, seen after the jellyfish fly off]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Anchovy Jellyspotter," [off-screen in ominous voice] Wha-wha-wha! [cut to the fields, where Kevin has a jar of jelly]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Jellyspotters allow jellyfish to eat jelly off their face. [Kevin smears some jelly on SpongeBob]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Who wants to lick my cheeks? [some jellyfish swim by] I see I have some takers?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," How does it feel? [SpongeBob now has jellyfish on his face, put together in the form of a mustache and beard. He laughs]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, It tickles my nose!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Not for long. [he and the Jellyspotters snicker. SpongeBob sneezes and all of the jellyfish fly onto Kevin's eyes. They sting them and now he has big red swollen eyes]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Anchovy Jellyspotter, Wha-wha-wha!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, [turns to the fish making that taunting noise] Will you cut that out?!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Am I in the Jellyspotters now?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," No! I have many more tests for you to take! [cut to SpongeBob walking upside-down, with a net and a jellyfish]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Am I in the Jellyspotters now? [the jellyfish stings Kevin's nose, making it big and swollen]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, No. [cut to SpongeBob having caught a jellyfish blindfolded]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Am I in the Jellyspotters now? [the jellyfish stings Kevin's crown and it becomes swollen, into some broccoli-shaped blister]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, No. [cut to just SpongeBob]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Now? [we hear zapping sounds. Now Kevin's ears are big and swollen]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, No. [cut to just SpongeBob again]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Now? [more zapping noises. Kevin's lips are now huge and swollen]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, No. [cut to Sponge once more]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, Now? [Jellyfish zaps Kevin. Kevin's buttocks is now huge and swollen]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, [screaming] No!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Now? [Jellyfish zaps Kevin] Now? [Jellyfish zaps Kevin] Now? [now, Kevin is just a big swollen sea cucumber thing]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Okay, SquarePants, it is your turn to get zapped! I mean... are you ready for your final test?"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, I'm ready!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," You'd better be, because we're going to capture a queen jellyfish."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, A queen? Can I help?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Oh, don't worry. We can't do it without you! [cut to SpongeBob being tied by arms and legs, hanging from two sticks]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either.
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Well, then you've probably never used a queen jellyfish call. Why don't you try it out? [he hands him a blower thing. SpongeBob blows and it makes a weird groaning sound that sort of sounds like, ""Loser.""]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hey, I've heard this call before."
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, I'll bet you have. [the Jellyspotters walk off]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hey, where are you going?"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Oh, don't worry, we'll be right behind this bush. [they kneel down behind it. Kevin gets zapped again. He stands up covered in sores, a jellyfish flies off] Who's got my sting ointment? [he kneels down again]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter! [he continues to blow that horn thing, which keeps saying, ""Loser."" Soon, it becomes dark and he's tired of blowing] Hey Kevin, I don't think it's working. Nothing? [a giant shadow looms over SpongeBob. He looks up, to find a giant jellyfish with a tiara. It's The Mechanic Jellyfish Queen!] Hey, hey Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She's here? [the bush blows away, revealing nothing? except Kevin's ointment. SpongeBob screams and the jellyfish zaps the poles off. SpongeBob runs up and down hills, dodging the jellyfish's stingers. He comes upon a cliff and can't go any further. He begs on his hands and knees] Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go! [cries. Just then, a screen on the jellyfish opens, revealing Kevin and the Jellyspotters. They laugh. SpongeBob gasps] Kevin!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, That's right! You should have seen the look on your face when we zapped you!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, But... What about my final test? [they all laugh]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Did you think we'd actually let you into the Jellyspotters?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," But Kevin, I was your biggest fan!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," So were they. [he points to the bottom of the cliff, where a bunch of people are by a fire. One looks up]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Guy," Look everybody, Kevin's back! [they all yell up at him in praise]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," You looked so dumb with your dorky jellyfish call! [He and the Jellyspotters imitating] Loser, loser, loser loser loser! [SpongeBob blushes and sad frowns]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, I am not a loser!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Loooooser! [as Kevin continues saying ""loser,"" a giant, even bigger than the queen, jellyfish comes from the cliff. It is wearing a robe and a crown.] Ah-ha-ha-ha! [The Jellyspotters finally notice] Cnidaria rex!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, King Jellyfish! [the king sees the queen and is instantly smitten. It grows lips and puckers up]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, Kissyface! [the queen and SpongeBob run off. The king gives chase. The queen eventually crashes into a billboard for Kevin's Ointment and breaks apart.]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Jellyfish King," Huh? [The king sees Kevin, the Jellyspotters, and SpongeBob. Record scratch sound effect. Kevin quivers.] [angrily] Keeeee-viiiiin! [it zaps the ground and they all run off. They find refuge in a cave. The king jellyfish comes back with a helmet and football uniform and attempts to bash in the cave. Inside, the Jellyspotters and SpongeBob are pretty scared. The bashing stops]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," I think he's gone. One of you go out and check. [the Jellyspotters push one fish out of the cave to see. The anchovy Jellyspotter looks around and ""meep-meep""s happily, giving the all-clear. But he's zapped and ""meep-meep""s not to come out. All the Jellyspotters go around Kevin asking what to do]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Jellyspotters," Meep! Save us! Meep Kevin, save us! [More meep begging]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Don't look at me! I was just in this for the fashion! [close up on Kevin's pants, with patches, stickers and a toy jellyfish coming out of his pocket] It's hopeless! We're trapped! We're trapped! [he sits down and curls to a ball] Help me, mommy! Help me! I want my blankie! I want my blankie!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, [to fishes] Now what do we do? [the Jellyspotters get down and imitate Kevin. SpongeBob decides enough is enough and goes out to face the king. The king growls and buzzes. SpongeBob takes out a bottle of bubble mix in response.]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Jellyfish King," What the? [SpongeBob inhales and blows a bubble in the shape of a giant cherry pie. The king, satisfied, leaves to eat his snack.] Hmm? Mm, mm, mm! Yummy! [The fishes come out and gather around SpongeBob. Other jellyspotters ""meep"" happily. Kevin follows]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, I can't believe it! How did you know?
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob, [laughs] Everybody loves pie!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Anchovy Jellyspotter, [ominous voice] Wha-wha-wha!
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin," Well, SquarePants, that was impressive, but you're still not in the club because you didn't catch a queen jellyfish. [the other Jellyspotters narrow their eyes and run over to Kevin, off-screen] Wait, what are you doing? [rip] Aaah! [the fish run back with Kevin's crown and place it on SpongeBob. He laughed]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Wow, I didn't know this was a hat! [Kevin shown with a torn part where his ""crown"" used to be. Kevin stands in agony, both for emotional and physical reasons.]"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Kevin, [teary-eyed] It wasn't... [cut to back at the convention. SpongeBob talks to Patrick]
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Hi, Patrick!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick," Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,SpongeBob," Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!"
I'm Your Biggest Fanatic,Patrick," Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson. [pan out to see that Pat has Jeffrey Jellyfish tied up in a wagon he's towing] Hero worship is unhealthy. [the two walk off] C'mon, Jeffrey."

Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, I'll get the Aqua-Glove.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Mermaid Man," Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, What about the Orb of Confusion? [turns the orb on and makes confusion faces]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Mermaid Man," [turns it off] No, no! Prolonged exposure from the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, [opens then closes the boat's door] What about the invisible boat mobile?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Barnacle Boy," Especially not the invisible boat mobile. When we say don't touch anything, we mean don't touch anything. Do you understand?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob and Patrick, Loud and clear trusted boy companion!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Barnacle Boy," Well, great. Here are the keys. [SpongeBob takes the key from his hand] We'll see you in a week."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Mermaid Man," [both run out the door] Up, up, and away."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Come boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay. [both flip into the other room while yelling karate sounds]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, What is it trusted sidekick?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob and Patrick, MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! Man Ray! Ahh! [both hide]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Looks like he's frozen or something.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... [licks the chamber] ...made out of frozen tarter sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil ManRay is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him. [Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE] Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, But you said you had a question.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, We could get in trouble.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Well, that's not a question. [they both argue when ManRay's eyes start to light up]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! [pulls level up back to FREEZE]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, I'm free! Hahaha!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Uh, actually, Mr Man Ray, sir, only your head is free."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Well, uhh, Mr. evil ManRay sir, we can't do that."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, Why.. Not?!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Because you're evil!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," You mean, if I was good then you'd let me go?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Yeah, sure, why not?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Then, uh, in that case... I am good."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Really?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Yes, really."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Really, really?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Yes, yes, really, really."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Really, really, really?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Well, that's good enough for me. [SpongeBob pulls the lever back to ""UNFREEZE"" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," You fools, prepare to be eradicated. [tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs] What's wrong with me? Hahaha. What is this... Hahaha. infernal contraption?!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Narrator, [showing a picture of the belt] As seen in episode 17!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Oh, I love that episode."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Oh, me too, me too."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, I'll never get out of here wearing this belt. [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. [chuckles again] Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Oh, sob! Oh, cry. [opens and closes his eyes] Oh, woe is me. You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," [turns around] Ahh, that would be fantastic! [chuckles] I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,[laughs],
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school? [Man Ray puts an apple on his desk] Pat, get your wallet out. [Patrick gets his wallet out his pocket] Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. [Patrick tosses it on the ground] Now, what do you do?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Doesn't look familiar to me.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Nope, it's not mine."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Return what to who?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," [facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID] Aren't you Patrick Star?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Yup.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, And this is your ID.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Yup.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, That makes sense to me.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, Then take it.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, It's not my wallet.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, [in anger and frustration] You dim-bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off! [SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Nuh. Wrong. [SpongeBob pushes button] Good people don't rip each others arms off! [Man Ray chuckles] Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggle with a heavy package. What do you do?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help? [Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot] Ow!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Oops, sorry. Can I start over?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, I noticed that... [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Oops. Gotta start again. [Patrick drops package again]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Could, Ow!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Oops!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, My wallets.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, [in rage] Arghh! [Man Ray grabs Patrick head and slams him into the ground a lot]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," No! SpongeBob, tickle him! [SpongeBob pushes the tickle button but ManRay keeps slamming Patrick into the ground]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, It tickles but it's worth it.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Alright, goodness lesson number three. [Patrick is shown being severely damaged] Uhh, let's see. [Patrick grabs the remote]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, Umm... 62?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Wrong! [pushes button]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray, Haha. Stop.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Let go of it, SpongeBob."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Let go!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," No, you let go!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob and Patrick, Let go! [remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Frequency rising. Bel- Belt out of control. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard. [he continues to laugh] It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop! [tears come out as he laughs] Haha. Please!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Peanuts?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, No. Please.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Rehabilitated.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Gesundheit.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. [unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops] Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. [Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons] Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. [Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it] We're not supposed to touch it that way, either. [Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove] We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] good people have no use for weapons such as... [Man Ray zaps them into dust] Thoooose!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," [laughs] The only thing I'm good at is being evil. [door opens and Man Ray runs] So long, suckers."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," What's that smell, SpongeBob?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Good, I thought it was my skin."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man..."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, ...and Barnacle Boy! [both slide down pole and get their costumes on]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, To the Invisible Boat Mobile. [both stop in the invisible boat]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Ignition, on!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Wait! I don't have a license.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick," Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. [shapes hand into a rectangle]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle boy. [boats drives through the wall and into a street light]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Thank goodness for invisible seat belts.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Out of my way, fools. You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to, ManRay!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the orb of confusion. [Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion] Take this! [turns it on and gets all confused] Doy. Duh."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Well, that was easy. [heads to the bank where he kicks in the door] Hahaha. All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,[citizens gasp],
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," I want you to, uh... [Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too] No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... [chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling] Stop laughing, you fools."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Bank Lady," What can I do for you, sir?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," Well, I'll tell you what you can do. [points glove at the lady] Gimme all of your... [Man Ray chuckles again] G-gimme, gimme all of your... [Man Ray is still chuckling] Give me... [he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on] Ahh! The belt is gone but I still feel it's tickle. The urge to do bad is gone. [groans] I guess I'll just open a checking account. [Man Ray returns to Sponge Bob and Patrick and turns the orb of confusion off]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob, Doy. [gasps] Man-Ray!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Man Ray," No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! [Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob] I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. [walks off]"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick! Patrick?"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,Patrick, Uhh... [still has a confused look on his face]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,SpongeBob," Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?!"
Squirrel Jokes,"[Lights are circling outside the Krusty Krab. Inside, there is a sign hanging from the ceiling that says 'Komedy Krab']",
Squirrel Jokes,Mr. Krabs," Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome [pauses] to the Komedy Krab! [Puts an arrow on his eyes. Everyone laughs] Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams. [Dougie walks onto the stage as Mr. Krabs walks out]"
Squirrel Jokes,Dougie Williams," Good evening, folks. I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you. [Pulls out a cart of pies. The crowd takes out their umbrellas. SpongeBob opens the curtain from behind and gets splattered with pie]"

Squirrel Jokes,[No one laughs. A cricket is heard chirping. Cut to a live-action clip of a cricket chirping.],
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things? [Chuckles weakly. Crowd is still silent] I mean, you chop them up into slices, but... [Cut again to the cricket, who is no longer chirping.] What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup? [Chuckles weakly]"

Squirrel Jokes,Fred, Forks?! Come on! [Crowd is booing]
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," [Thinking] Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation! [Looks around for material then notices Sandy's teeth] Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are? [Crowd chuckles]"
Squirrel Jokes,Fish, That's true.
Squirrel Jokes,Sandy, Huh?
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things. [Crowd laughs more] And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home too. [Crowd laughs loud]"
Squirrel Jokes,Patrick, [Laughing] Squirrel fur!
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt. [Crowd laughs] Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?"
Squirrel Jokes,Harold, Why?
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," Because, they're so darn stupid! [Crowd laughs]"
Squirrel Jokes,Patrick," That's a good one, huh, Sandy?"
Squirrel Jokes,Sandy," Uhh, y-yeah... [SpongeBob walks behind the curtain where Mr. Krabs is waiting for him]"
Squirrel Jokes,Mr. Krabs," That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!"
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob, I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.
Squirrel Jokes,Mr. Krabs, The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show. [Hands SpongeBob a mop]
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob, At least I don't have to clean up my act! [Laughs]
Squirrel Jokes,Mr. Krabs," Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy. [Walks off]"

Squirrel Jokes,Sandy," Howdy, SpongeBob."
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob, Did you enjoy the show?
Squirrel Jokes,Sandy," Well, ac-actually SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it."
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," Come on Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom."
Squirrel Jokes,Sandy," Well, I can't argue with that."
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob, We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time! [Holds up a mirror and laughs excessively into it. Sandy chuckles]

Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," Ok Sandy, Ok! I get it! [SpongeBob is filled up every inch of the Treedome] No more squirrel jokes. [Scene cuts to the Komedy Krab where the crowd is chanting for SpongeBob again] Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel. [winks at Sandy. cut to Patrick show his happily exciting smile, Sandy blinks with a smirk] And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.' [Crowd laughs] But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge! [Crowd is silent] I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae! [Twists himself] Look at me! I got no bones!"
Squirrel Jokes,Fish #6, That's true. [Crowd laughs]
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," Crabs? Oh brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!"
Squirrel Jokes,Mr. Krabs," [Laughs] It's true, I am cheap!"
Squirrel Jokes,SpongeBob," Now let me tell you about those fish? Boy are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really! [Imitates a fish] Soap... soap... what is... soap? [Crowd laughs more. SpongeBob and Sandy give each other a thumbs-up as the scene cuts to an outside view of the Krusty Krab] And don't even get me started on starfish!"
Pressure,Sandy," [looking at the clouds] You know, SpongeBob, sometimes it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by."
Pressure,SpongeBob," Yup, and just relax."
Pressure,Sandy, Yeah. Relax.
Pressure,SpongeBob, Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
Pressure,Sandy, What?
Pressure,SpongeBob, A flower.
Pressure,Sandy," They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time."
Pressure,SpongeBob, They sure do.
Pressure,Sandy," You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty."
Pressure,SpongeBob, Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
Pressure,Sandy," Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first."
Pressure,SpongeBob, Yeah.
Pressure,SpongeBob and Sandy, [both laugh] Me.
Pressure,SpongeBob," That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest."
Pressure,Sandy, Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? [points to her acorn patch]
Pressure,SpongeBob, I thought that meant you were nuts.
Pressure,Sandy," Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land."
Pressure,SpongeBob," [laughs] Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! [his fingers flex] What do you think about that, ""Miss Mittens""?"
Pressure,Sandy, I'd say I'm already halfway there!
Pressure,SpongeBob," Ahh! [begins to climb the mountain] Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!"
Pressure,Sandy," Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! [collapses the rock SpongeBob is climbing on]"
Pressure,SpongeBob, Hey! [gets back on another rock] You did that on purpose!
Pressure,Sandy," Yeah, but this is an accident! [unleashes more rocks at him]"
Pressure,SpongeBob, [screams] Aaaaah!
Pressure,Sandy, Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
Pressure,SpongeBob," [holds on to an umbrella and floats up] I didn't! [laughing, reaches the top of the cliff]"
Pressure,Sandy," [sitting in a lounge chair, reading a newspaper] Well. It's about time you showed up."
Pressure,SpongeBob, [gibberish] I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
Pressure,Sandy, Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
Pressure,SpongeBob, I can underwater! I'm... [Low voice] Hydrodynamically designed! [Normal voice] Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
Pressure,Sandy," Why don't use ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you think of that, HydroPants?"
Pressure,SpongeBob, I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! [zooms out to reveal a record player] -halfway there!-halfway there!.
Pressure,Sandy, [gasps] Hey!
Pressure,SpongeBob," [running at the bottom of the mountain, laughing, hits a brick wall]"
Pressure,Sandy," [jumps on SpongeBob's face and over the brick wall] Thanks for the face lift! [runs into the Krusty Krab, laughing] You see, I told you that you didn't-"
Pressure,SpongeBob," [dressed as an old man] There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature [licks lips] waiting! [rips off suit, laughing]"
Pressure,Sandy, I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
Pressure,SpongeBob, I did! And I took a head start like you did!
Pressure,Sandy," Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!"
Pressure,SpongeBob," I guess I don't, air breather!"
Pressure,Sandy, Water sucker!
Pressure,SpongeBob, Tree climber!
Pressure,Sandy, Gulf streamer!
Pressure,SpongeBob, Kite flier!
Pressure,Sandy, Chum chewer!
Pressure,SpongeBob, [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person!
Pressure,Sandy, Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
Pressure,SpongeBob, Proves what?
Pressure,Sandy, That land critters are better than sea critters!
Pressure,Patrick, [walks to the two] Better at what?
Pressure,Sandy Cheeks," Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!"
Pressure,Squidward, [walks to the three] What's she blabbering about?
Pressure,Patrick, She says land creatures are best.
Pressure,Sandy," Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking [Mr. Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!"
Pressure,"[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp]",
Pressure,Sandy," And name calling, for sure!"
Pressure,Squidward," And drowning, don't forget drowning!"
Pressure,SpongeBob," [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo!"
Pressure,Squidward," Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls]"
Pressure,SpongeBob," I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature."
Pressure,Sandy, Squirrels can do anything they want to!
Pressure,Patrick, I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah.
Pressure,Sandy," [reaches offscreen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy, begins to laugh]"
Pressure,Patrick," Thank you, thank you."
Pressure,Sandy," Well, there's just one thing."
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that.
Pressure,Sandy, [Tries to do it] Uh...uh...
Pressure,Squidward, How about this? [balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh?
Pressure,SpongeBob, Can you reproduce by budding. [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya?
Pressure,Sandy, No!
Pressure,SpongeBob," Most importantly...can you do this? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath]"
Pressure,Sandy," Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?"
Pressure,SpongeBob," Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing]"
Pressure,Sandy," Well, you know... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! [rips off suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble]"
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, Neptune preserve her!
Pressure,Squidward, How long can she stay like that?
Pressure,SpongeBob, I don't know!
Pressure,Patrick, Sandy's a girl?
Pressure,SpongeBob," Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... [Sandy winks] Yep, won't be long now. [she starts struggling to hold her breath] Feelin' light-headed yet?"
Pressure,Sandy, Mm-mm. [Sandy shakes her head]
Pressure,SpongeBob, Remember this? [SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out]
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out]
Pressure,Sandy," [Starts suffocating underwater, screen cuts to her insides and her right lung breaks and falls off, she looks around and quickly searches through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All others start laughing] Stop laughing at me!"
Pressure,Mr. Krabs," I knew it! There was no way some ""airhead"" was gonna win anything against a water breather!"
Pressure,Patrick, Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top]
Pressure,"SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs", Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
Pressure,Sandy," All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!"
Pressure,Squidward," Do we have to wear pickle jars? [all, except Sandy, laugh]"
Pressure,Sandy," Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs."
Pressure,SpongeBob," One minute? No problem, Landy! [all but Sandy begin to laugh]"
Pressure,Sandy," [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you going or not?"
Pressure,SpongeBob," Actually, you know, but..."
Pressure,Squidward," We can't, uh...because..."
Pressure,Mr. Krabs," Well, um... we're late for our..."
Pressure,Patrick, Our fitting!
Pressure,Sandy," Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!"
Pressure,Patrick, [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken]
Pressure,SpongeBob," Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished."
Pressure,Sandy," Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!"
Pressure,SpongeBob," No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!"
Pressure,"Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs", Yeah!
Pressure,SpongeBob, Where not afraid of your dumb old land!
Pressure,"Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs", Yeah!
Pressure,SpongeBob, We're sea creatures!
Pressure,"SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs", Yeah!
Pressure,SpongeBob," Okay... Well, this is it."
Pressure,Mr. Krabs," Wait, boy! [gives him a glass of water] Make it last."
Pressure,SpongeBob," [drinks from it] Thanks Mr. Krabs Ok! Here I go! [gasps out of water, He's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick] Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!"
Pressure,Patrick," I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!"
Pressure,SpongeBob," All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!"
Pressure,Mr. Krabs," All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho! [runs up. he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick]"
Pressure,SpongeBob," Looking good, Mr. Krabs!"
Pressure,Patrick, Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!
Pressure,SpongeBob," Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!"
Pressure,"SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs", [chanting] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
Pressure,Squidward," Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it. [walks up. he's a puppet squid with his eyes and big nose. [all stop chanting] ...What?"
Pressure,SpongeBob," Well, here we are. [all four are walking on the island]"
Pressure,Squidward, This is pretty easy.
Pressure,Patrick, I may keep a second rock up here.
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, Once you get your land legs it's not so bad!
Pressure,SpongeBob, We're the masters of land and sea!
Pressure,SpongeBob," [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey, a local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [seagull looks at screen]"
Pressure,Sandy," 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better congratulate them. [walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [sees the seagulls attacking all four of them] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah! [attacks the birds and feathers start flying. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.]"
Pressure,SpongeBob," Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy."
Pressure,Sandy," You know, everyone's best at something."
Pressure,SpongeBob," But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy."
Pressure,Sandy," Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob."
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
Pressure,All, Hooray!
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, Hip hip!
Pressure,All, Hooray!
Pressure,Mr. Krabs, Hip hip!
Pressure,Seagulls, [lying on island with their feathers missing] Hooray.
The Smoking Peanut,[The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Zoo],
The Smoking Peanut,Narrator, Ah... Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual free day. Free balloons...
The Smoking Peanut,"[Mr. Krabs, disguised in a mustache, steals a whole bunch of balloons from Jimmy]",
The Smoking Peanut,Narrator, Free drinks...
The Smoking Peanut,[Mr. Krabs comes by and fills up a huge barrel],
The Smoking Peanut,Narrator, Free... light bulbs?
The Smoking Peanut,[Mr. Krabs unscrews a light bulb from a lamp post and puts it into his pants just as the police arrive],
The Smoking Peanut,Mr. Krabs," Aha! Top of the mornin', boys! [Laughs nervously] Next stop gift shop."
The Smoking Peanut,"[As he runs into the gift shop, SpongeBob and Patrick walk by wearing zoo hats]",
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, [Like an announcer] He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air! Like a cannonball!
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob crumples up his hat and spits it into the air and into a little fish's ice cream],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, What are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!
The Smoking Peanut,[The two run into the stadium],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob and Patrick, This is the greatest day of our lives!
The Smoking Peanut,[Clamu is snoring and gurgling],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring!
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," You're right, Patrick. We came to see [Announcer voice] pearls 100 feet in the air, [normal voice] Right? I'll try my oyster call."
The Smoking Peanut,"[SpongeBob makes a strange noise, but he gives up, because the oyster is asleep]",
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob."
The Smoking Peanut,[Patrick walks away],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Come on, come on, wake up already! [He pulls out his bag of sea peanuts. He looks left and right and then throws one at the oyster. The oyster stirs] I think it's working!"
The Smoking Peanut,[The oyster frantically looks around],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Hey Patrick, it's waking up!"
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Oh boy, did I miss it?"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," No, the show's about to begin!"
The Smoking Peanut,[The oyster suddenly cries at the top of its lungs. SpongeBob and Patrick get blown away to the seats. The oyster hops around while bawling. Two zoo employees come running into the arena],
The Smoking Peanut,Zoo Worker #1, What's wrong with Clamu?
The Smoking Peanut,Joe," Easy girl, it's me, Joe! Remember?"
The Smoking Peanut,[The clam snarls as if it sounds like a belch and uses its tongue to throw Joe out of Oyster Stadium. Patrick and nervous SpongeBob wait at the stands],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, Now this is a show!
The Smoking Peanut,[Outside],
The Smoking Peanut,Announcer, Attention zoo patrons! Clamu the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles. [everybody runs for their lives and scream] Thanks for coming.
The Smoking Peanut,"[In the stadium, Clamu is still smashing things and making snarling belch noises. The zoo worker goes up to SpongeBob and Patrick]",
The Smoking Peanut,Zoo Worker #1," You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster!"
The Smoking Peanut,[The worker points menacingly at SpongeBob],
The Smoking Peanut,Zoo Worker #1," You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Uh...
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?"
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob hides the peanut bag],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Right. [SpongeBob lets out a nervous shriek]
The Smoking Peanut,[Clamu chomps on a piece of metal. Cut to Patrick and SpongeBob leaving the zoo],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Man, if I see the guy who upset Clamu, I've got a few choice words for him, like ""you""... and ""are"" ... and ... ""a jerk!"""
The Smoking Peanut,"[SpongeBob and Patrick have now gotten to Conch Street, where their houses are]",
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," I already said I didn't, Patrick! Sheesh!"
The Smoking Peanut,[Walks up his cobblestone path into his pineapple],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home! [Inside the pineapple] Stupid Patrick, I didn't do anything wrong. Ah, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory!"
The Smoking Peanut,[He chuckles and turns on the TV],
The Smoking Peanut,Johnny," Our top story tonight giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world! [TV is shown with real people covering their ears in Egypt, Holland, and India] A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens!"
The Smoking Peanut,"[SpongeBob feeling guilty, appearing horrified]",
The Smoking Peanut,Johnny," What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures?"
The Smoking Peanut,[Hans uses a tissue to wipe a tear off Johnny's face. SpongeBob turns off the TV],
The Smoking Peanut,Gary, Meow?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," [screams] No Gary, how would I know anything about the oyster?"
The Smoking Peanut,Gary, Meow.
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something? [He peers out the window at Oyster Stadium, where we hear Clamu's shrieking] This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry. I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I, I need some advice! Now let's see now, who could never hate me no matter what I do? [Cut to SpongeBob knocking on Squidward's door] Squidward? Squidward! Oh, Squidward!"
The Smoking Peanut,Squidward, SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Sorry, neighbor."
The Smoking Peanut,Squidward, Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster."
The Smoking Peanut,Squidward, You know the guy who did it?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, [gulps]
The Smoking Peanut,Squidward," Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically."
The Smoking Peanut,Squidward, You mean you don't know who did it?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Well, um... I... uh... no. [Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Squidward?"
The Smoking Peanut,"[SpongeBob sighs and walks away. On his way home, he encounters Patrick in a Sherlock Holmes outfit]",
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, Gotcha! [SpongeBob screams and jumps out of his pants]
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Hey Patrick, what are you doing?"
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the great Clamu Caper!"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Um, have you found out anything?"
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Yes! No wait, uh... no. [Holds up sand] But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, and so does this rock! [Holds up magnifying glass to look at a piece of grass] And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!"
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob runs away],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, I better go see Sandy! She'll know what to do!
The Smoking Peanut,"[We see Sandy and SpongeBob in the treedome, and Clamu is still shrieking]",
The Smoking Peanut,Sandy," Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy."
The Smoking Peanut,Sandy," Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery-pokery!"
The Smoking Peanut,[Holds up the Bikini Bottom Phone Book and rips it in half in front of SpongeBob],
The Smoking Peanut,Sandy," Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?"
The Smoking Peanut,"[SpongeBob tries to speak, but cannot]",
The Smoking Peanut,Sandy," Hey SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut! [He runs home]"
The Smoking Peanut,Sandy, SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob runs down the block panting. He runs to the house and tries to open the door. Patrick approaches him to talk],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob!"
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob is startled and he falls apart. His limbs and facial features all reattach in different places],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it. [Zoom in on Patrick's mouth licking what appears to be SpongeBob's head. It is revealed to be instead licking a yellow ice cream pop that appears to be shaped like SpongeBob's head] Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow popsicle hits the spot!"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Okay, good luck with all that Patrick, and, um, I guess I'll see you later!"
The Smoking Peanut,"[He shuts the door, and inside]",
The Smoking Peanut,Police Fish #2, Open up! This is the police!
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob's eyes pop out of his head],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Uh, uh, just a second!"
The Smoking Peanut,[Two policefish bust in and one flashes his I.D],
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #2, Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Y-y-yes.
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1," Put those eyeballs back in your head, son! We've got a few questions for you."
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob puts them in and twists them like a dial until the are positioned. Policefish #2 taps the baton on his hand while Policefish #1 talks.],
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1, Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, [Stutters] Y-yes! [Hides in his pants]
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1," Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Yes... [He sinks even lower into his pants]
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1, And are you familiar with... this peanut?
The Smoking Peanut,"[Holds up a zip-locked peanut with ""Exhibit A"" written on it]",
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Yes!
The Smoking Peanut,"[His eyes peer out over the top of his pants. The bottom of his pants rip, and his body falls through]",
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1, Just one more question... Is it true that you at the oyster's lair with a Mr. Patrick Star?
The Smoking Peanut,[sobbing],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Yes! Yes! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!"
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1," That's all we need to know, son. Let's book him! [clink. The police put the cuffs on Patrick]"
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," Wow, you guys are good. I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!"
The Smoking Peanut,Policefish #1," Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, Pinky!"
The Smoking Peanut,[Police Man and Police Man 2 escort Patrick out],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Oh no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house!
The Smoking Peanut,[SpongeBob follows the police boat to the zoo],
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!
The Smoking Peanut,[crowd booing and yelling],
The Smoking Peanut,Sandals," Hey everybody, let's throw peanuts at him and see how he likes it!"
The Smoking Peanut,[crowd yelling],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, I get what I deserve! [Crowd yelling. Patrick attempts to catch all the peanuts with his mouth.] Ouch.
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness...
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick," [Singing while SpongeBob talks] Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum..."
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I..."
The Smoking Peanut,Sandals, Ay! Just get on with it!
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. So I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom. [Patrick stops singing]"
The Smoking Peanut,Sandals, Hey! Let's throw peanuts at both of them!
The Smoking Peanut,[crowd yelling],
The Smoking Peanut,Zoo Worker #1, [objecting] Wait! Here's the real criminal!
The Smoking Peanut,Mr. Krabs," Uh, top of the mornin'!...? [his fake mustache falls off]"
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs!
The Smoking Peanut,[All gasping],
The Smoking Peanut,Patrick, I knew it!
The Smoking Peanut,Zoo Worker #1, Mr. Krabs has stolen a very important item from the oyster. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes by accident] Behold! [the crowd gets disgusted] Wait a minute..[reveals Clamu's pearl] Behold! The oyster's pearl! [Gives the pearl to Clamu] Here you go girl.
The Smoking Peanut,"[Clamu sniffs her pearl and the crowd cheers. But suddenly, the pearl starts to crack. And to everyone's amazement, it hatches into a baby oyster.]",
The Smoking Peanut,Baby Oyster, Mama! Mama!
The Smoking Peanut,SpongeBob," Mother of pearl! That oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!"
The Smoking Peanut,Baby Oyster, Mama!
The Smoking Peanut,Clamu, Aww!
The Smoking Peanut,[The baby oyster and Clamu embrace each other.],
The Smoking Peanut,All, Awww... [They glare at Mr. Krabs]
The Smoking Peanut,Mr. Krabs, But it's free day!
The Smoking Peanut,[crowd yelling and then they throw peanuts at Mr. Krabs],

Shanghaied,Patchy," Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if your technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-"
Shanghaied,Potty, Bawk! In what way?
Shanghaied,Patchy," Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people."
Shanghaied,Potty, Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Shanghaied,Patchy," Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go? Potty, you in here, buddy?"
Shanghaied,[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window],
Shanghaied,Potty," [laughs and squawking] Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha."
Shanghaied,Patchy," Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Now, what was I saying? Now this cartoon ain't like most of your ""land-lobbing cartoons"". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to call the number their that's scrolling at the bottom of the screen... [""1-800-624-4094 or go to Nick.com"" appears on the bottom of the screen (in the First 100 Episodes version it says ""Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!"" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone] No, not now! Don't call 'till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- [More phones start to ring] Your not gonna make this easy are ya. Quiet! Vast their! Be laze that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!"

[Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Shanghaied,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, I know! What do you think we should name it?
Shanghaied,Patrick, How about...
Shanghaied,Squidward, Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Clean...
Shanghaied,Squidward," [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Squid, wait! Wait!"

Shanghaied,Narrator, A few inches later...
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [points up] Ship!
Shanghaied,Patrick," SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No, look, a giant ship!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]"
Shanghaied,Squidward," All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says ""owner"" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Shanghaied,Patrick, I don't know. Why?
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Shanghaied,Patrick, Yes!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says ""property of the Flying Dutchman""]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Rawr!!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No, no, it's not ""rawr!"""
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, I am the Flying Dutchman!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
Shanghaied,Squidward," I...no, I don't."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, [screams] Ow.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick, [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Welcome back!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Shanghaied,Squidward," Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," So, are you gonna try that again?"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, How 'bout now?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh...
Shanghaied,Squidward," [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Now listen. [takes out a ""Ghost Rule Book""] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, Will we be getting business cards?
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television."
Shanghaied,Squidward," Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in a blank worried face.]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the ""Fly of Despair""?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman."
Shanghaied,Patrick, We'll do anything you say!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, And I got this hat!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably..."
Shanghaied,Patrick," No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Shanghaied,Patrick, I don't get it.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Look, it's easy, it simply means that..."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," So, you don't want it to look good?"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick," [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [screams]
Shanghaied,Patrick, Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, [howls like a wolf]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [screams]
Shanghaied,Patrick, Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
Shanghaied,[Very long and awkward silence],
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it a little to land on a little kid]"
Shanghaied,Billy," I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Captain, we'll buff out those scratches."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Shanghaied,Patrick, How does he do that?
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Get back on the ship.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick, It's still a mystery!
Shanghaied,Billy, Those guys are dorks.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Like movie passes?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, You're setting us free?
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]"
Shanghaied,Patrick," Wait, I have an idea!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Really?! What is it?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Let's leave!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Shanghaied,Patrick, Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, I always hate going in there!
Shanghaied,Patrick, Yeah.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Dear Diary I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Never!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ok, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, No! [Sock begins to tear]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Make it five.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Four.
Shanghaied,Patrick, Three. Take it or leave it.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ok...uhh, three. You get three wishes."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]"
Shanghaied,Squidward," Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick, Squidward! You're back!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one."
Shanghaied,Squidward," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!"
Shanghaied,Patrick," Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish..."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and..."
Shanghaied,Voting Guy, All hands! All hands! Its time to vote! Its voting time!
Shanghaied,Patchy," Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be, Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good 'Ol SpongeBob. [""Just dial the number below 1-800-624-4094 or go to Nick.com and tell us who you be choosing"" appears on the bottom of the screen (again, in the First 100 Episodes version it has been changed to ""Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!"")] My trusty crew, is eagerly awaiting your call. So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, And we'll be right back to announce, the winner! [Cuts To Commercials, then ""That's it, kids! Keep them coming! It's almost time! Keep those votes in! Ha Ha Ha! WHOO! Democracy! Ha Ha Ha! WHOO! This is Patchy, please hold. Potty's not here. Well, not yet. HA HA HA HA!!!!!"" appears on screen (in the First 100 Episodes version, this text was removed entirely)] Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because its time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner! [blows horn] But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter ology, You didn't choose, Patrick. [An image of Patrick is shown, with a skull in front of him.] But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh gaw!"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Patrick.]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," That's you, Patrick. Make your wish."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh...
Shanghaied,Squidward," Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh...
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh...
Shanghaied,Squidward and SpongeBob," Come on! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Put on your thinking cap!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh... [Inside Patrick's eye is a toaster that brings up some toast.] Okay! I've got it.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Thou wish is granted.
Shanghaied,Patrick," [Chewing on gum.] Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? [SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked.]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, You wished for gum?
Shanghaied,Patrick," Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!"
Shanghaied,"[Each take a piece of gum. Later, we see Flying Dutchman with a big belly.]",
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Aaaah! Let us out!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ahh, minty."
Shanghaied,Patchy," Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh! [An image of Squidward is shown, with a skull in front of him.] It appears you didn't vote for Squidward. I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either! But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Squidward]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's right! And you know what I wish?
Shanghaied,Patrick, No!
Shanghaied,Squidward, I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, So be it.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Hi.
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's not what I meant!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner [Flying Dutchman appears with a big belly]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, And what did you say your name was?
Shanghaied,Squidward, I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. [Tries to pronounce it right] We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. [Laughs.]"
Shanghaied,Patchy," And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob! [A flag is shown with SpongeBob with the words ""Winner"" on the left side, Patchy blows his nose] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!"
Shanghaied,Potty," Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]"
Shanghaied,Patchy," And now, the most requested ending! Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Shanghaied,Squidward," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]"
Shanghaied,"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward", Hooray!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, We're home!
Shanghaied,Patrick," You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Hey, I get a wish too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast."
Shanghaied,Patchy," [Patchy is shown sitting at the counch crying] Hold on! Sorry about that kids! Its just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker! [Cuts to a bunch of monkeys at a zoo] Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks Potty! Potty!"
Shanghaied,Potty, Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!
Shanghaied,Patchy," Ohhh! Oh, that's it folks! Right now I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty I'm not kidding!"
Shanghaied,Narrator," And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special! Thanks for voting!"
Shanghaied,Patchy, [Bite sound's heard] OW!
Shanghaied,Narrator," And now, it's time for Patchy's Pick. Hosted by SpongeBob's number one fan, Patchy the Pirate."
Shanghaied,Patchy," Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to Patchy's Pick. Why don't come on back on the galley, I got a little treat for you today. We're gonna see me favorite show Shanghaied! Ta-da!"
Shanghaied,Potty, Boring!
Shanghaied,Patchy," Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people."
Shanghaied,Potty, Bawk! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Shanghaied,Patchy," Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go? Potty, you in here, buddy?"
Shanghaied,[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window],
Shanghaied,Potty," [laughs and squawking] Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha."
Shanghaied,Patchy," Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Well, roll the cartoon."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," [eating Kelp-O cereal] Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Shanghaied,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, I know! What do you think we should name it?
Shanghaied,Patrick, How about...
Shanghaied,Squidward, Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Clean...
Shanghaied,Squidward," [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Squid, wait! Wait!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Shanghaied,Narrator, A few inches later...
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [points up] Ship!
Shanghaied,Patrick," SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No, look, a giant ship!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]"
Shanghaied,Squidward," All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says ""owner"" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Shanghaied,Patrick, I don't know. Why?
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Shanghaied,Patrick, Yes!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says ""property of the Flying Dutchman""]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Rawr!!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No, no, it's not ""rawr!"""
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, I am the Flying Dutchman!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
Shanghaied,Squidward," I...no, I don't."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, [screams] Ow.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick, [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Welcome back!

Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," So, are you gonna try that again?"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, How 'bout now?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh...
Shanghaied,Squidward," [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Now listen. [takes out a ""Ghost Rule Book""] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]"
Shanghaied,Squidward, Will we be getting business cards?
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television."
Shanghaied,Squidward," Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in a blank worried face.]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the ""Fly of Despair""?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman."
Shanghaied,Patrick, We'll do anything you say!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, And I got this hat!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably..."

Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Look, it's easy, it simply means that..."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," So, you don't want it to look good?"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick," [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]"

Shanghaied,Patrick, Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
Shanghaied,[Very long and awkward silence],
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it a little to land on a little kid]"
Shanghaied,Billy," I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Captain, we'll buff out those scratches."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again."
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Shanghaied,Patrick, How does he do that?
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Get back on the ship.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick, It's still a mystery!
Shanghaied,Billy, Those guys are dorks.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Like movie passes?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, You're setting us free?
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]"
Shanghaied,Patrick," Wait, I have an idea!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Really?! What is it?
Shanghaied,Patrick, Let's leave!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Shanghaied,Patrick, Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, I always hate going in there!
Shanghaied,Patrick, Yeah.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Dear Diary I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Never!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ok, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, No! [Sock begins to tear]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Make it five.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Four.
Shanghaied,Patrick, Three. Take it or leave it.
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Ok...uhh, three. You get three wishes."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?"
Shanghaied,Patrick, Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]"
Shanghaied,Squidward," Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob and Patrick, Squidward! You're back!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one."
Shanghaied,Squidward," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!"
Shanghaied,Patrick," Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish..."
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]"
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]"
Shanghaied,Squidward," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]"
Shanghaied,"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward", Hooray!
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, We're home!
Shanghaied,Patrick," You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!"
Shanghaied,Squidward, But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Hey, I get a wish too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast. Patchy reappears]"
Shanghaied,Patchy," Ahoy, children! I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls enjoyed the show because it's time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time for fan mail! [blows horn]"
Shanghaied,Old-time crowd, Hooray!
Shanghaied,Patchy," And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, so get ready to blow milk out of your nose because we're gonna open a letter! The envelope please Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant."
Shanghaied,Potty," [Potty has a lighten fuse on his head] Brawk, you're not welcome."
Shanghaied,Patchy," [Patchy blows his nose] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!"
Shanghaied,Potty," Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]"
Shanghaied,Patchy," Well, that's it for Patchy's Pick. Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]"

Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [worried] That's you Patrick! Make your wish!
Shanghaied,Patrick, Umm...
Shanghaied,Squidward," Wait, Patrick. Listen, I do not particularly want to be trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," [rushes in] Patrick, you've got to think harder than you ever thought before."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Uhh...
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, That's not going to do it! Think harder!
Shanghaied,Patrick, [thinks harder] Uhh...
Shanghaied,Squidward, [simultaneously with SpongeBob] Come on Patrick! Come on! What are you thinking about?
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," [simultaneously with Squidward] Come on Patrick! Yes, think, think really hard! [Patrick goes really intensely thinking] Yes Patrick! You're doing good!"
Shanghaied,Patrick, [his head's toaster ejects bread] Okay! I got it!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Your wish is granted!
Shanghaied,[Gum appears in Patrick's pocket. Patrick eats some gum.],
Shanghaied,Patrick," Oh, I'm sorry... Want some gum?"
Shanghaied,[SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked],
Shanghaied,Squidward, You wished for gum?
Shanghaied,Patrick," Well, if we're going to be there forever, we might as well have fresh breath!"
Shanghaied,[SpongeBob and Squidward take a piece of gum each and chews some gum as well],

Shanghaied,SpongeBob, Squidward! You get to have a wish! A great big wish!
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's right! And you know what I wish?
Shanghaied,Patrick, No!
Shanghaied,Squidward, I wish that I never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman, Your wish is granted. [magically makes SpongeBob and Patrick not know Squidward]
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Hi there, my name is SpongeBob and this is my associate Patrick."
Shanghaied,Patrick, Hi!
Shanghaied,Squidward, That's not what I meant!
Shanghaied,Flying Dutchman," Well then, since you've been choosing to get out of the way, it's time for dinner! [grabs out a metal knife and fork]"
Shanghaied,SpongeBob, [in the Flying Dutchman's belly] And what did you say your name was?
Shanghaied,Squidward, [also in the Flying Dutchman's belly] I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
Shanghaied,SpongeBob," Oh, nice to meet you, Squidward. We have plenty of time to know each other, I guess. [laughs]"
Shanghaied,[...],
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again bath time. [Gary's pupils dilate] Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, [zooms in on Gary's eyes] or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... [Gary just stares] So that's how you wanna play it, huh?"
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch [Throws the ball to Fetch. Toy boomerangs back to SpongeBob and he reads the box] Huh? ""New"" Boomerang Pet Ball Really Works! Hmmm. [throws the box but it boomerangs back and hits SpongeBob in the head]"
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob, Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!... [Gary doesn't react] ...Please... [bomb explodes] ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.
Gary Takes a Bath,"[pictures of a bathtub, a shower faucet running, and then a bar of soap come up then a Scottish Girl picture appears]",
Gary Takes a Bath,Subliminal Girl, [Laughs in a high voice]
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," ""I'm sorry you had to see that."" [on the phone] Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language! [hangs up] Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn. [flips Gary into the wall and breaks his shell, then we see Gary with his shell bandaged] Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog? [Gary whacks him on the head with a cane] ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house! [Mr Krabs comes in taking a bath then steals SpongeBob's dollar] Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh? [SpongeBob dresses as a pirate] Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... 40. The treasure must be in here! [opens bathroom door] Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest."
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, Meow.
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," Why no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure. Look, doubloons. [shows 2 bars of soap] Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! [shows a rubber ducky]"
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, Meow.
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is on SpongeBob] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub!! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub... [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub. [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but he floats over the tub, and appears back on the floor after 2 seconds] Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you... [Gary sucks in one of his eyes into his head and SpongeBob loses grip] Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! [SpongeBob falls in the tub]. Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. [absorbs all the water in the bathtub]. Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. [SpongeBob spits water at Gary but misses and hits the armchair instead]. Come back, Gary. I have something to ""chair"" with you. [SpongeBob spits more water at Gary but misses and hits dirty dishes, which cleans and stacks them] ""Dishes"" more like it. ""Water"" you waiting for, Gary?"
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, [meowing in a tree]
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. [spits out water at Gary but realizes it's a gramophone playing a record of Gary's meows]. Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin. [Gary takes the ladder off the tree] Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant. I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now."
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, Meow.
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob, I am so the boss of you!
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, Meow.
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules."
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, Meow.
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister. [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half...[Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say three! [Gary leans further over the mud] Gary! Gary! Gary! GARY! [SpongeBob falls out of the tree and into the mud] I'm a dirty boy."
Gary Takes a Bath,Gary, Meow.
Gary Takes a Bath,SpongeBob," Yeah, yeah, Gary. I'm getting behind my ears. [Gary grins]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,[The Krusty Krab at night. The lights are still on],
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," Come on SpongeBob, it's quittin' time. [the lights turn off and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk out] I've got a card game tonight. [he locks the doors]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? [we see the Chum Bucket across the street, with its lights still on]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. [SpongeBob gasps]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," [Gasps] Plankton! [a thought bubble appears over SpongeBob's head with Plankton inside] But Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy. [he picks up a Krabby Patty] He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years. [the Plankton in the thought bubble sees the Krabby Patty and goes to get it, but SpongeBob swats him with a fly swatter]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Ouch. [the thought bubble disappears]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Why would you play cards with him?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom! [cut to him and Plankton holding cards and a giant stack of money on the table] Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years! [Mr. Krabs puts his cards down on the table and rakes in his money with his claws. Back to the present, Mr. Krabs' eyes have turned to dollar signs] I never lose! [the two start laughing and walk off their separate ways. Cut to morning where Mr. Krabs walks to work crying, and SpongeBob walks in laughing]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, [Sobbing]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Taking him to the cleaners, that a hot one! [Mr. Krabs leans against the Krusty Krab doors] How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, I lost.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, I didn't lose any money. [he sheds away a tear] I lost...
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, I lost... [SpongeBob grabs him]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, I lost... [he points to SpongeBob] you!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, What?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," I bet your contract and I lost. [SpongeBob stares blankly, then laughs]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. [he begins to walk to the door, but Mr. Krabs' claw stops him.] [after continually walking and getting nowhere, he falls to the floor]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. [Squidward runs out the door to the two]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Squidward, Please tell me this isn't a joke.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. [Plankton walks over]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking. [he points at SpongeBob] You work for me now, SpongeBob! [he whips out a bucket with the initials ""CB"" on it] Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. [Plankton jumps on SpongeBob's head, kicks off the Krusty Krew hat, and puts the bucket on his head. SpongeBob screams and runs to Mr. Krabs, knocking Plankton and the bucket off]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, But Mr. Krabs! I don't want to work for him! [he tugs at Krabs' shirt collar] I want to work for you here at the Krusty Krab! [he and Krabs start crying loudly and hug]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," [pretending to sound genuinely sad] What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship? [whips out a crowbar] I would! [he jumps up and uses the crowbar to pry SpongeBob off Krabs. SpongeBob goes flying with Mr. Krabs' arms still clung to him]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs! [he slams into a cage and Krabs' arms fly off him. Plankton walks over and shuts the door]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," This is your greatest blunder, Krabs! For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up! I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula but I've got the next best thing the guy who makes 'em! [a propeller emerges from the cage] I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs. [the propeller spins and pilots SpongeBob into the Chum Bucket]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob! [he cries] Can I have my arms back? [Plankton walks over and throws the arms on Krabs' head. Cut to the cage hovering over a spotlight and dropping SpongeBob into it]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," What is this place? [the lights turn on and screens with wires and gizmos start starting up. Sponge gasps. A giant boiler turns on. SpongeBob yelps. A light turns on and a calendar entitled ""Science!"" appears and the photo of the month is some nerd in front of a blackboard. Sponge screams. Plankton bursts open the doors]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Ok, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! [he walks over to SpongeBob]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh..."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now [he jumps onto SpongeBob's knee] and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef! [we see a giant robot that bares a slight resemblance to SpongeBob] So get cooking. [he twangs SpongeBob's nose. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a weird looking grill. He picks up a spatula with a spring end. He puts his fingers to one of the holes in the grill and steam bursts from it. SpongeBob screams. He looks at a digital sign reading ""KITCHEN""]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Karen," You know that never works! The answer is obvious to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,[We see SpongeBob struggling to make a Krabby Patty with one of Plankton's cooking machines],
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, [Sound of surprise]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Hi!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," I'm sorry Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Well, I usually cook on a grill."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," You got it! [Plankton brings a grill into the Chum Bucket] Well it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," [gasps] Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Say no more, I'll take care of everything. [Plankton pushes the grill] How about here?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, A little more to the left.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," How's this, SpongeBob?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Move it over a little more.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Here?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Keep going.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Here?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right. [Plankton gasps]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," [cut to a blindfolded SpongeBob] Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Ok, go ahead, take it off! [he removes the blindfold] It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! [his face turns sad. wailing] Oh...Mr. Krabs!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... [cut to SpongeBob with some fancy vibrating shoes on] Wow!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Well... [cut to SpongeBob in a bubble bath, licking green mint ice cream]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, You ready to make some patties?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Wait till I finish my ice cream! [cut to SpongeBob riding a toy car, with Plankton pushing him]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, [while pushing him] How about those patties?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Faster! Faster! [cut to Plankton reading to SpongeBob a baby book]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," And then the littlest sea-elf said... [drool drops on Plankton. SpongeBob is sleeping. He wakes up] Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, All this preparation is making me hungry.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," [laughs] Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," [yawning] No, I don't really feel like it!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," But I don't understand. [SpongeBob drinks soda from a cup] You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair. [loses his cool as he exposes his hands with fumes rising out] I rubbed your putrid feet!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," Tell you what, half-pint why don't you ask me later!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, [growls in fury] I command you to make me a patty this instant!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, [crossing his arms in refusal] No!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Don't back sass me!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob, [mocking Plankton] Do ba da ma!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," What!? [SpongeBob blows a raspberry as he moons at him] That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges. [cut to Plankton outside of a lab] Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants... [to the audience] I put the brain in the robot, you know. You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want, and I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Robot SpongeBob," [Beeping] Dee dee, doodle dee di do. Response Why don't you ask me later?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, [going mad] What? What!?
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Robot SpongeBob, Get welded.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, [pressing the button on the control] Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Robot SpongeBob, [reads comics and drinks oil] I don't wanna.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, [screams out of madness]
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," [cut to the Krusty Krab] Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter. [holds up an ""Out of Business"" sign] Huh?"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, [crying] I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," Um...Well... [taking off the ""Out of Business"" sign off the doors] a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton," Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! [Mr. Krabs throws Plankton back inside the Chum Bucket]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Plankton, Thank you! [a crashing sound is heard] Ouch.
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs."
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs," Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,SpongeBob," [Yawns] I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, crabby? [Mr. Krabs stares at him] I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat! [runs to the kitchen]"
Welcome to the Chum Bucket,Mr. Krabs, That's what I thought you said.
Frankendoodle,French Narrator," Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck."
Frankendoodle,Artist," Hmm... ah! [draws some strokes. he hums something. however, he throws his pencil into the sea] My pencil! What?"
Frankendoodle,French Narrator, The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea Always bring a spare pencil.
Frankendoodle,Artist," Nooo! [with loudly sound. cut to the pencil dropping into the water. cut to SpongeBob and Patrick playing ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" with bubbles]"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," OK. Ready, Patrick? One..."
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Two...
Frankendoodle,Both, Three!
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Scissors beats paper, Patrick! [laughs] One..."
Frankendoodle,Both, two...
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," three! Patrick, how come you always do paper? [the pencil drops and the two scream]"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, What is that thing SpongeBob?
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, It looks like a giant pencil.
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Go touch it.
Frankendoodle,[SpongeBob extends his arm and touches the pencil],
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," It is a giant pencil, Patrick! [SpongeBob grabs the pencil] Let's draw some giant pictures with it."
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Whatcha drawin'?
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Psh, artists."
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, It's a jellyfish.
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Pretty good, SpongeBob! But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired."
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Eh, everybody's a critic."
Frankendoodle,[The drawing comes to life],
Frankendoodle,Patrick," SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic!"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," No, I mean it's swimming away!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Do you know what this means, Patrick?"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Your art can never hang in a museum.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, It means we found a magic pencil!
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, [laughs] Coming right up! [draws mustache on Patrick]
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Life is good! [the mustache floats away] Easy come, easy go!"
Frankendoodle,Squidward," Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea! You've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of... [the mustache goes on his head] hair!"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, My turn!
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such."
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, Okay! Why didn't you say so? Hey! Another jellyfish!
Frankendoodle,Patrick," It's Squidward, silly!"
Frankendoodle,[The badly drawn Squidward comes to life],
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
Frankendoodle,Patrick," You're right, SpongeBob."
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, We can't let it go into town! [Patrick erases it]
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Poor Squidward.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Hey! My brain just hatched an idea. [he draws a dollar on Squidward's green mat, attached to a string while laughing] This is gonna be classic!"
Frankendoodle,Squidward, [dressed up] I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," [doorbell rings] Oh, Squidward!"
Frankendoodle,Squidward," [opens door] What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy! [SpongeBob pulls the string] Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair! [it floats away] SpongeBob!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll!? All he needs is a tie. [Draws a tie] Ready for action! [Laughing]"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, He's going to the door.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, He's knocking on the door.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, Squidward's answering the door and...
Frankendoodle,[DoodleBob pounds Squidward's head on the ground],
Frankendoodle,Squidward, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Frankendoodle,Patrick, He's beating up Squidward!
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," DoodleBob, stop! [he throws Squidward back in his house. DoodleBob is out of control, he steals the magic pencil and then runs away with it]"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, He's got the pencil.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, What have I done? We've got to find him! Where could he possibly be?
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Come on, let's go! [Patrick hides in a bush]"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, I'm not going in there [SpongeBob also hides]
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... [DoodleBob draws a hole. They fall into it]"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, What just happened?
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob," [speaking nonsense] Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. [a wrench falls and hits Patrick on the head]
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob, Neofineyin!
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," See what I mean, Patrick?"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Where's the leak, ma'am? [DoodleBob draws a bowling ball and rolls it. Patrick's head turns into a bowling pin in surprise] Yurrgh! [Hits Patrick and some pink bowling pins and a ""strike"" symbol appears. Another ""strike"" symbol then appears after the bowling ball falls into the hole.]"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," You okay, Patrick?"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Finland!
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob," [speaking nonsense and more nonsense] Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay! [he runs off in the distance, Bubble transition to a coral rock wall and a field]"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, There he is.
Frankendoodle,Patrick," He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, Eh hem.
Frankendoodle,Patrick," [blushes] Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh."
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?"
Frankendoodle,[DoodleBob breaks through the coral rock wall where SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind.],
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob, [nonsense] Bawahh bwah bwah wahh! [DoodleBob grabs SpongeBob]
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, Patrick! Patrick! Do something!
Frankendoodle,Patrick,  Happy birthday!
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, [DoodleBob throws SpongeBob.] Arrgh!
Frankendoodle,Patrick, [Gives DoodleBob a rock] Here's your present. [DoodleBob bashes it on his head] You're welcome.
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob, [nonsense] Dewaaagheaugaaagh! [DoodleBob was about to run for his life until SpongeBob stops him whilst holding the pencil in his face]
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?"
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob," [speaking nonsense fast] Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," I'm sorry, what was that?"
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob," [Slowing gibberish down] Bee ha, bala hala ba ba! [DoodleBob starts to shout more gibberish while SpongeBob erases his face. DoodleBob mutters then he hits a rock]"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good. [begins to erase DoodleBob to oblivion] Take that and this and this and that and this that this that... [screaming] I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Take it easy, it's just a drawing."
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?"
Frankendoodle,Patrick, Done and done.
Frankendoodle,"[When SpongeBob and Patrick go home, it is soon revealed that one of DoodleBob's arms is still alive]",
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, goodnight, sweet prince."
Frankendoodle,Gary, [with a crown on] Meow.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Goodnight, magic pencil. [Falls asleep. DoodleBob's arm goes into SpongeBob's house, it starts going up the stairs and takes a bathroom break, finally he sneaks up to SpongeBob's bed, grabs the pencil, and starts to re-draw himself. He wakes up] Oh hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? [laughs] [DoodleBob pops up in his bed; SpongeBob screams] DoodleBob! [slightly chuckles] No hard feelings, right? [DoodleBob draws two angry eyebrows on his face and jumps on SpongeBob's bed holding the pencil threatingly] [screams] What do you think you're doing, doodle?!"
Frankendoodle,DoodleBob," You doodle! Me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams and jump out of the ways as DoodleBob erases his pillow then part of SpongeBob's house whilst chasing SpongeBob, they chase downstairs. DoodleBob erases a door and the back of SpongeBob's pants, revealing his butt] Huh? [Erases his butt]"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," [screams] Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? [DoodleBob erases his nose] I nose. [DoodleBob erases some parts of his face and body, DoodleBob laughs at the way he looks now] Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. [When SpongeBob and DoodleBob struggle, the pencil breaks into two. SpongeBob has the lead and draws the rest of his face and body back] Well, doodle, it looks like this is a draw. [DoodleBob sharpens the pencil with his mouth. He now has both sides] You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. [the lead piece flies out of his hand, crashes through the window and hits Squidward]"
Frankendoodle,Squidward," [offscreen] Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Or maybe it was most clumsy. [DoodleBob starts to attack him again as SpongeBob hides in a bookshelf, as DoodleBob approaches him he gets his foot stuck in a piece of paper on the floor, DoodleBob sees this and tries to get it off] Huh? [SpongeBob looks in a book] Paper! [DoodleBob tosses the pencil from his hand] Page for Mr. Doodle! [Smashes him with a notebook. SpongeBob watches as DoodleBob is preserved as a drawing, when it's was all over he smiles. The next day, SpongeBob hangs the piece of paper on the wall with a push-pin]"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?"
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Take a look for yourself, Patrick."
Frankendoodle,Patrick, [Gasp!] It's the evil doodle!
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose."
Frankendoodle,Patrick, So... he's a drawing?
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob, Exactly! See how happy he is?
Frankendoodle,Patrick, [He looks at the paper with DoodleBob on it] He still looks kind of creepy.
Frankendoodle,SpongeBob," Oh, great magic pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?"
Frankendoodle,Patrick," Ready! [SpongeBob jumps on Patrick's belly, and the pencil is launched back to the surface]"
Frankendoodle,French Narrator, We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.
Frankendoodle,Artist," Huh? What's this? My pencil! [he draws a line, but the pencil breaks]"
Frankendoodle,French Narrator, [As the artist starts to cry] The second most important rule for the artist at sea Always bring a pencil sharpener.
Frankendoodle,Artist, Nooooo!
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," [as he runs to Patrick's rock] Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? [Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick]"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Oh, boy, am I!"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Here's your net. [Patrick glances at his box] Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves."
The Secret Box,Patrick," First, I have to put away my secret box."
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! [SpongeBob tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets."
The Secret Box,Patrick, You do?
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, I've got a gazillion secrets!
The Secret Box,Patrick, Like what?
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. [Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, You wanna hear one of my secrets?
The Secret Box,Patrick, Do I?
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, Uhh... Let's see... [he runs up to Patrick] Did you know that you're my best friend? [he runs away]
The Secret Box,Patrick," No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naive.
The Secret Box,Patrick," WOW! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. [SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box] Tell me some more secrets!"
The Secret Box,Patrick, Gasp. I never would have guessed.
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
The Secret Box,Patrick," No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. [Patrick imagines a carton of milk spilling itself]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," But, Patrick, I must know the secret!"
The Secret Box,Patrick," For the last time, SpongeBob, no!"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Come on, Patrick, just a peek?"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Never! [SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps] So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! [he shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob] Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! [as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm] If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," But... we're supposed to be... [his eyes get big and sad] friends forever. [flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.] I feel so filthy! [he starts to cry] I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! [he jumps on Patrick] I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? [we see a close-up of Patrick's box] The most amazing... [as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in] mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. [he eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Friends. [they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! [he slides down in his bed] Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. [he sits up] Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victim's severed heads in a box. [he hides himself in the blanket and shivers] Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! [screams, then jumps onto the bedroom window and talks a little muffled] I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! [SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back] That's it! How do you look in a secret box? [he jumps off the window] Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. [he turns around to show only his nose. He turns back around] Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Oh, what do you know, you're a snail! [SpongeBob sneaks to Patrick's house, puts gloves and a ski mask on him, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.]"
The Secret Box,Patrick, [as the camera zooms in on the box] Seee... cret.
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," [thinking] I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. [slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise]"
The Secret Box,Patrick, Duh... who's there? [he mumbles then goes back to sleep.]
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, [talking to his foot] Shhh! [SpongeBob steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound]
The Secret Box,Patrick," EH?! [gibberish] WHO'S THAT?! [Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.] Mmm... water. [he licks his mouth dry, then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an ""AWOOOOGA!"" noise. He then steps again, making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, then takes the step, making a very loud crashing noise. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box] Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. [opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs. He lets go of his tongue] Nighty-night, boxie. [he puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. [Patrick wakes up]"
The Secret Box,Patrick, Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!
The Secret Box,Patrick," It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! [he runs up to SpongeBob] Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! [he cocks his pillow like a shotgun]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! It's me, SpongeBob!"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me."
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," No, really, Patrick! Look! [Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring," It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!"
The Secret Box,Patrick, Our friendship ring! IT IS YOU! [crying as he covers his face with his pillow] How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. [he throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands]"
The Secret Box,Patrick," [with a tear coming out of his eye] That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is OVER!!!"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, [gasps and tears up] Really?
The Secret Box,Patrick," Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to."
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," OK! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! [he lifts the lid off the box] Huh?"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Well, didn't I tell ya? [we see a string inside the box] Isn't it great?"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, It's just a string.
The Secret Box,Patrick, A secret string!
The Secret Box,SpongeBob," Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! [he puts the lid back on the box] Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!"
The Secret Box,Patrick," Good night, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house]"
The Secret Box,SpongeBob, I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! [he laughs] Wait 'till I tell Gary!
The Secret Box,Patrick," [laughs menacingly] Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the... [a secret compartment opens] ...secret compartment of my secret box... [he takes out a photo] ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party! [cut to the Bikini Atoll] Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! [laughs as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]"
Band Geeks,"[ A horrible sound is heard, which turns out to be Squidward playing his clarinet until the doorbell rings. Doctor Forrest is at the door]",
Band Geeks,Doctor Forrest," Yeah, uhh, we're with the pet hospital down the street and I understand that you have a dying animal on the premises. [Squidward slams the door shut. Phone starts to ring.]"
Band Geeks,Squidward, Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the [plays a clarinet note]
Band Geeks,Squilliam," Sounds like you've got a dying animal to attend to, eh ol' chum?"
Band Geeks,Squidward, [gasp] Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!
Band Geeks,Squilliam, I hear you're playing the cash register now.
Band Geeks,Squidward," Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow?"
Band Geeks,Squilliam," [Waving his unibrow] It's big and valuable. I'm the leader of a big fancy band now, and we're supposed to play the Bubble Bowl next week."
Band Geeks,Squidward, The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!
Band Geeks,Squilliam," That's right. I'm living your dreams Squidward. The problem is, I'm busy next week and can't make it. So, I was hoping you and your band could cover for us."
Band Geeks,Squidward," Ohh, uhh, I... I, uhh..."
Band Geeks,Squilliam," I knew it! You don't even have a band! Well, I'll just let you get back to the service industry now."
Band Geeks,Squidward," Hold it! It just so happens that I don't sell fast food, I do have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!"
Band Geeks,Squilliam, Good luck next Tuesday. I hope the audience brings lots of... ibuprofen! [hangs up phone]
Band Geeks,Squidward," I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor. [In the following lines, Sandy, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Mr. Krabs, and Larry are reading from a poster]"
Band Geeks,Sandy," Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life?"
Band Geeks,Plankton, Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom.
Band Geeks,Mrs. Puff, And be forever adored by thousands of people you don't know.
Band Geeks,Mr. Krabs, Not to mention free refreshments.
Band Geeks,Larry, Practice begins tonight. 830 sharp. [Squidward looks at his watch while driving a shell cart]
Band Geeks,Squidward," Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor."
Band Geeks,"[Cuts to inside the room, everyone is there]",
Band Geeks,All," Blah, blah, blah, blah..."
Band Geeks,Squidward," People, people, settle down! Ok, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before?"
Band Geeks,Plankton, Do instruments of torture count?
Band Geeks,Squidward, No.
Band Geeks,Patrick, Is mayonnaise an instrument?
Band Geeks,Squidward," No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument. [Patrick raises his hand again] Horseradish is not an instrument, either. [Patrick lowers his hand] That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you. [laughs]"
Band Geeks,[Everyone stays silent],
Band Geeks,Mr. Krabs, So when do we get the free food?
Band Geeks,Squidward," Ok, try to repeat after me. [Squidward plays 6 notes] Brass section, go. [brass section repeats badly] Good. Now the wind. [wind section repeats badly] And the drums. [drummers misunderstand what Squidward means, so they blow on their sticks which blow out and stick Squidward to the wall] Too bad that didn't kill me. [Next scene] Let's just try stepping in the rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five."
Band Geeks,SpongeBob, Is this the part where we start kicking?
Band Geeks,Squidward," No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line."
Band Geeks,Patrick, Kicking? I wanna do some kicking! [Patrick kicks Sandy in the leg]
Band Geeks,Sandy," Ow! Why, you...! Why I oughta...! [she jumps on Patrick and starts fighting him until they roll outside and the doors slam shut]"
Band Geeks,Patrick," [Makes a very long painful scream.] [Everyone pauses and stares at the door, then Patrick sticks his head back in] Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on. [Patrick walks in and it is revealed that Sandy has stuck his body in a trombone. Trombone notes are heard as he walks towards his seat. As he sits down, he makes a sound of his trombone. Makes a loud trombone noise as he opens his mouth. Stares at himself.]"
Band Geeks,Narrator, Day two. [band walking down a street playing Semper Fidelis badly]
Band Geeks,Squidward," Okay, that's perfect everybody. Bubble Bowl here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers let's move! C'mon, move! [Flag twirlers spin so hard that they take off into the sky and crash into a blimp, which causes an explosion. Trumpet player plays taps while everyone mourns, except Squidward, who just lies down on the ground]"
Band Geeks,Narrator, Day three.
Band Geeks,Squidward, How's that harmonica solo coming Plankton?
Band Geeks,Plankton," It's tremendous, you wanna see? [Plankton plays the harmonica by running to and from holes, but soon runs out of breath; on his way to the last hole he blows an unsuccessful last raspberry into the harmonica and faints]"
Band Geeks,Narrator, Day four.
Band Geeks,Squidward," Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that none of you improved since we began... [Patrick chews on a trumpet] ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?"
Band Geeks,Plankton, [loudly] Correct!
Band Geeks,Squidward," So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four! [screen cuts to the outside of the music school and a blast of noise ensues, breaking the windows. Cuts back inside music school, where Squidward's face is deformed beyond recognition, his shirt's been ripped and his baton breaks] OK, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us."
Band Geeks,Harold," Well, maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty claws!"
Band Geeks,Mr. Krabs," What did you say, punk?!"
Band Geeks,Harold, [Shouts loudy] Big... Meaty... claws!
Band Geeks,Mr. Krabs," Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates."
Band Geeks,Harold," Bring it on, old man! Bring it on!"
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off."
Band Geeks,Nancy," Oh, so now the talking cheese is gonna preach to us."
Band Geeks,Squidward," Wait, wait. I know tensions are high... [everyone gets into a fight. Pilar and Larry are yelling at each other. Medley slams a drum at him] There's a deposit on that equipment, people! [everyone uses their instruments as weapons. Mr. Krabs and Harold charge at each other with large woodwinds, but try to screech to a halt, and Mrs. Puff slams them both with her cymbals] Settle down, please! [Sandy and Frank are fighting. Sandy breaks the xylophone keys from Frank and Frank runs away. Patrick kicks Sandy, who growls at him before producing a trumpet with an evil grin. Patrick realizes what's coming and runs away screaming as Sandy chases him with the trumpet. Cuts to the clock which shows 10 o'clock and everyone stops fighting]"
Band Geeks,Fred," Hey, class is over. [they all walk to the door where Squidward slams it open]"
Band Geeks,Squidward," Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness...and crushed it! Crushed it into little tiny, bite-size pieces. I really expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks. [sobbing] Thanks for nothing! [Leaves]"
Band Geeks,Patrick, You're welcome.
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him?"
Band Geeks,Evelyn, A fireman.
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you?"
Band Geeks,Larry, Some guy in an ambulance.
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band."
Band Geeks,Harold," Yeah, for the fireman!"
Band Geeks,All, Hooray!
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," Now let's make Squidward proud. A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo."
Band Geeks,[At Bubble Bowl],
Band Geeks,Squidward, I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that... [zooms out to reveal Squilliam is there] ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam! [screams] What are you doing here?!
Band Geeks,Squilliam," Oh I just came to watch you blow it. So, where's your band?"
Band Geeks,Squidward," Uh, they couldn't come. They... died."
Band Geeks,Squilliam, Then who's that?
Band Geeks,Squidward, [screams and his eyes pop out] That would be my band!
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," We're ready to perform, Squidward."
Band Geeks,Squilliam," Well, Squiddy, this is exactly how I pictured your band would look. [SpongeBob dances]"
Band Geeks,Squidward, That's his... eager face. [Squilliam laughs while they all go into the Bubble Bowl]
Band Geeks,Squidward," [everybody marches to the Bubble Bowl and starts performing] Well, I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town."
Band Geeks,SpongeBob," That's the spirit, Squidward. [bowl raises above a football field]"
Band Geeks,Football Announcer," Okay, football fans. Put your hands together for the Bikini Bottom Super Band!"
Band Geeks,[A crowd of live-action people is shown.],
Band Geeks,Patrick, These are some ugly looking fish.
Band Geeks,SpongeBob, Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps.
Band Geeks,Mr. Krabs, I think I'm gonna be sick.
Band Geeks,Squidward," [Nervously] Alright, everybody. [Glances at Squilliam, who grins and bounces his unibrow] Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4..."
Band Geeks,[Band plays wonderful intro. Squidward opens his eyes. SpongeBob begins singing],
Graveyard Shift,French Narrator," Ah, The Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about..."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," [talks cheerfully as he switched the Open sign to Closed] Now! 800! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is [pulls out his clarinet] Clarinet. [Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet] What?"
Graveyard Shift,Tom, Are you open?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, [points to sign] Read the sign.
Graveyard Shift,Tom, I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a double chili kelp fries.
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life."
Graveyard Shift,Tom," Well fine, if you don't want my money!"
Graveyard Shift,Mr. Krabs," [says cheerfully] Money?! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward] You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?"
Graveyard Shift,Tom," [pulls out cash, Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him] Sure!"
Graveyard Shift,Mr. Krabs," Mr. Squidward, [tears up the Closed sign] welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, What!? [crowd of fish barge in cheering]
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, Mr. Krabs..
Graveyard Shift,Mr. Krabs," See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. [leaves]"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, Mr. Krabs?
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," Isn't this great Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! [gasps] It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! [jumps on cash register counter] Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, No.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, [Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat] Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen [laughs] at night!"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, [takes hat off; leans head on counter] Don't hold back.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," [cuts to SpongeBob in kitchen] Hey Squidward. Guess what, I'm chopping lettuce...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself] Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams] I burned my hand!...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge] Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Will you please?! Here, [hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage] give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, All right! [takes bag from Squidward] Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. [stops at the door] You mean outside?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," That's where the dumpster is, yes."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," I don't know, Squidward, [leans face against window] it's kinda dark out there."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, But I thought you liked the night shift.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," You're right! [lifts bag over his head] For the Krusty Krab! [runs out of the building to the dumpster, screaming and panicking the whole way; reenters the building panting heavily. snaps his fingers and confidently says] Piece of cake!"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, So you're not afraid?
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," Pfft, nah."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Well I am. Especially after, [looks around, gulps] well, you know."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, [turns around] What? What do I know?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, You don't remember? It was all over the news.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Tell me! Tell me!
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. [gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," [excitedly] What happened, what happened, what happened!?"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," You mean you've never heard the story of the [thinks] ""Hash-Slinging Slasher?"""
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha [breaks into scream] because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, [begging] Tell me the story!
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, He forgot the secret sauce?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, No.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, He didn't wash his hands?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, No!
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Irregular portions?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, NO! He cut off his own hand by mistake.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," You mean like this? [pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place] Or like this? [pulls it again, another one grows back] Or this? [does it again] Or this? [does it again] But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or..."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, [interrupts] Except he wasn't a sponge!
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, [ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line] So?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, So it didn't grow back!
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," [screams] Oh, no! [all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Tuesday.
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, [gasps] But tonight's Tuesday night!
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, Then he'll be coming.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, How will we know?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next..."
Graveyard Shift,Harold," [interrupts] Dude, can I have some ketchup?"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Oh, here you go. [hands him ketchup] Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails] And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn] Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! [SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn] Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand.."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, No.
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," He opens the door [pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans torwards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in] He slowly approaches the counter [""counter"" echoes menacingly] ...and you know what he does next?"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, What?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, You really want to know?
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, What?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, Are you sure you want to know?
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," What, what, what does he do?!"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," [sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him] He gets ya! [SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing] SpongeBob... [continues screaming] SpongeBob I wa... [screaming continues] I was ju... [SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too] I was jus... [screaming continues] SpongeBob, I was joking!"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, What?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, It's not true! None of it's true!
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, It's not?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Ohhhhh. [laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming] [cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']
Graveyard Shift,[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.],
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," [on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning] Isn't this great, Squidward? [Squidward screams] There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, [says to himself] Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
Graveyard Shift,[cuts to Patrick's bedroom],
Graveyard Shift,Patrick, [Patrick's alarm clock goes off] Oh boy! Three A.M.! [whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! [lights start to flicker on and off] Very funny, SpongeBob."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, What?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," ""And the lights will flicker on and off."" Just like the story. I get it. [realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," Hey Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! [phone rings, Squidward picks it up] What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," [walks up to the counter] Nice try, Squidward."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Nice try, what?"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," ""The phone will ring and there will be no one there."" [raises eyebrows up and down and giggles] Oh, you crack me up."
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. [hangs up phone] Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, [lights flicker on and off] and the phone, [phone rings] and the walls will ooze green slime! [walls start to ooze green slime] No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? [hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, [walks up to the counter] I didn't know the buses ran this late.
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," They don't! [a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline]"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," Well they're dropping someone off. [from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, [screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling]
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," The SASH-RINGING, FLASH-SINGING, THE BASH-PINGING..."
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [starts to cry]
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, At last you understand! We're doomed!
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," No, that's not it. [wipes tear] I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me! [cries again]"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!? [the man taps on the door with his spatula]"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, [screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling]
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob and Squidward, THE HASH-SLINGING SLASHER!!! [the guy walks in the door and up to the counter]
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!"
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob," Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!"
Graveyard Shift,Squidward, Huh? [a nerdy unnamed guy reaches the counter]
Graveyard Shift,Hervy, Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. [holds up spatula] I called here earlier but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob, Do you have references?
Graveyard Shift,Squidward," Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? [lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward and Hervy look over to see Nosferatu]"
Graveyard Shift,"SpongeBob, Squidward and The Unnamed Guy", Nosferatu!
Graveyard Shift,Nosferatu, [smiles. light turns off]
Krusty Love,"[A normal day at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs stitches a cushion of money, while singing]",
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, La da dee. Stitch one per two. Doo da dee doo. Di dee dee da de... [abruptly stops and sniffs the air] What's that smell? [He runs over to the boat in front of the kitchen window] The register! [He smells it repeatedly] $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short! [he starts crying as Squidward walks by]
Krusty Love,Squidward," [sarcastically] Oh, no, not a penny. Help, somebody help us. [SpongeBob appears in the boat besides Mr. Krabs, consoling him]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," It's just a penny, sir. [Mr. Krabs stops crying to look at SpongeBob] It doesn't matter."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your pants square! [holds up a right-angled ruler to SpongeBob's pants] It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!"
Krusty Love,Squidward, [Squidward smells his armpit] Lilac.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! [Shows the Krusty Krab literally in large-sized bandages] Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that... [Something catches his eye] ...scrumptious curvy cutie."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," I see her, Mr. Krabs. [We see a Krabby Patty] A Krabby Patty with cheese. The classic."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Not the sandwich, boy! The curvy cutie holding the sandwich! [Shows Mrs. Puff eating the Krabby Patty prepared by SpongeBob]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Hey, that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff? Aw... she's married.
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Then what happened to Mr. Puff? [footage of Mr. Puff, now a lamp, being turned on]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, She doesn't like to talk about it.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! You look great! [his clothes have grease stains, his pocket is inside-out with mud coloring it, and his zipper is down] You wait here while I go break the ice! [quickly runs off]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooohhh... [At Mrs. Puff's table]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Hi, Mrs. Puff."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," [she screams] Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," [he snaps his fingers] Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Well, I'm not..."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Don't move! [Mrs. Puff tries to leave, but SpongeBob and Krabs get back to the table too soon]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to Mr... [Mr. Krabs falls forward onto the floor. SpongeBob props him back up]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," [Nervously] Uh, hello."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," [Mr. Krabs looks shy] Psst, Mr. Krabs, say hello."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [unintelligibly] Gla-gloo!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," No, no, Mr. Krabs, just say hello."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [makes a choking gasp-type noise]
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Hmm, perhaps another time would be..."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [yelling] No!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Wait, he's trying to tell you something!"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, Mr. Krabs?
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [jerking his eyes and moving his arms around weirdly] Dah me nam do um dah um!
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, I don't understand.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [taking to SpongeBob] Bo a blum, uh, do a blugh eh ou a blaugh!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Oh, uh, I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... hit you with a rake!"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, [Scared] Goodness!
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [yells again] No! [lifts his tall eyes up and down] Gla-goo, meep bo blargh uh hee!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, Try to guess your weight!
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, [Offended] Well!
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [flails his arms] Rraugh glorg mic floraug!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," No, wait... he wants to take you..."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Ca ca boom a lom!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, ...on a date! [Mr. Krabs gasps happily and falls over]
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Aye. What do you say?
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," What do I say? [starts laughing] I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs. [Laughs and walks away]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [chuckles] I still got it. [Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' house]
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Are you ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, [reading a list] Breath spray?
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [sprays mouth with breath spray] Check!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, Lucky hankie?
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Check!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, Giant rusty anchor?
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Ye..., anchor? Anchor! I can't find me giant rusty anchor! [SpongeBob throws the list away and laughs]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Relax, Mr. Krabs. Just a little joke. Good luck with you know who. [Makes a circle in the air and moves his eyebrows up and down twice]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Who's that?
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, Mrs. Puff.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad! [We now go to ""Fancy!"", a restaurant which is a ship in a glass bottle. We see Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff there]"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Oh, Mr. Krabs, this dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection. I don't think I could eat another bite."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," [laughs] You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean, foot rubs between courses... [shows a squid rubbing Mrs. Puff's feet] Caricatures... [Shows Mr. Krabs a picture of her on the beach with an enlarged head] Imported music... [A live-action scuba diver plays the piano on the other side of the room]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Uh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is..."
Krusty Love,Waiter, Sir? Your fancy pantsy limousine is here.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Wonderful! Pufflily-pooh, your chariot awaits!"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, Well...[Two men carry her to the limo and she screams]
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib! [He sighs as the waiter approaches him again]"
Krusty Love,Waiter," Your bill, sir."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [he takes the bill] What? $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!"
Krusty Love,Waiter," Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out. [he hands him a different bill] This is your bill."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [his eyes enlarge weirdly] [screaming] [the restaurant starts to shake, the cork pops off and the giant glass bottle breaks. Back at Mr. Krabs' house, SpongeBob is watching him sob on the floor]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, What are you going to do?
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money! [resumes sobbing]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, I wish there was some way I could help.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Perhaps there is, boy! [he hands him his wallet] I'm puttin' you in charge of me money!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," I don't get it, Mr. Krabs."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money! [The two walk to Mrs. Puff's metallic pink house]
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now, give me a dollar."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, Nope.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Good boy! You'll do fine! [Knocks on the door]
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, Who is it? [Krabs immediately becomes entranced. His eyes turn into hearts]
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," It's me, my beautiful bell buoy!"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, [giggles] Just a minute!
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, But you said...
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed! We ain't talking about this... [makes a square] ...or this... [makes a triangle] ...we're talking about this! [makes the circle from before]"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, Almost ready!
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Hurry, boy! Get the flowers! [SpongeBob runs off as Mrs. Puff comes out]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Mrs. Puff, you're as beautiful as ever."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," [laughs nervously] That's funny, I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent. [Hurries back inside]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Of course, my beautiful Puff. [Mr. Krabs sighs. SpongeBob returns with the flowers]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, I got the flowers you wanted me to buy."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, What's that?
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, I got the flowers. For Mrs. Puff.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," We had an agreement, boy! You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, But you said...
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Here I come! [She walks out, and Krabs grabs the flowers, once again hypnotized by his love for Mrs. Puff and gives the flowers to her]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," For you, Mrs. Puff!"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Oh, flowers! Oh, how thoughtful!"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," And here's a box of chocolates! [He holds out an empty claw] SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for..."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates! Hurry! Hurry! [SpongeBob runs off. SpongeBob comes back with the heart-shaped box of chocolates]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, I bought the biggest box they had!
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Oh, Eugene! [Krabs presents the box to Puff]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and..."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Well, I think she..."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, The sun's beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," As your financial advisor, I suggest that..."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, But...
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Today! Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll save you! [Places a barrel on Mrs. Puff's head.]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, hurry!"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, [as SpongeBob comes back from the store with a large straw hat] One shady hat.
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Good job, lad. [Puts the hat on Mrs. Puff]"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," Oh, well thank you. But you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Didn't need to buy one? [He turns his head around like an owl to face SpongeBob, still grinning] You hear that, boy? [in high pitch] We didn't need to buy a hat. [angrily] Aren't you supposed saving me money!?"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing."
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!"
Krusty Love,Narrator, A few moments later...
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [happily as hearts float in the background] SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat! [After SpongeBob buys one, Krabs is mad and flaming dollars float in the background]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, You're spending all me money! [happily] Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! [SpongeBob gets the shoes]
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [angrily] You're breaking me boy! [happily] She needs fine jewelry! [SpongeBob gets the jewelry] Not that fine! [SpongeBob runs back and forth, speeding up, carrying various items as Mr. Krabs keeps yelling his name. He eventually becomes too tired to move] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a pink umbrella] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a bicycle] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a purple surfboard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a grandfather clock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with an anchor barbell] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a TV] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back and forth with lots of presents] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"
Krusty Love,"[his voice echoes, and SpongeBob is seen sitting on the ground, his arms stretched, and he is panting]",
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," [runs up, his eyes are shaped like hearts] SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff..."
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, [imitating Mr. Krabs] ""Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!"" And then I'll say, ""But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!"" Then you'll say, ""We're not talking about this..."" [Makes the square] ...""Or this""... [Makes the triangle] ...""we're talking about this!"" [He squiggles all over the screen. The screen fades out for a moment. Fades back in to see SpongeBob panting with Mr. Krabs.]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," But lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! [Cut to Mrs. Puff who has many unneeded, expensive items surrounding her]"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff, Are we going to the park soon?
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Please lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! [Starts to cry]"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Ok, I, I'm going to get it, see? [Walks offscreen, and comes back with a washing machine] Cheer up, Mr. Krabs! Here's that washing machine you wanted!"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
Krusty Love,SpongeBob, See?! You just did it again!
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money. [SpongeBob gets a blank expression on his face] Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?"
Krusty Love,SpongeBob," Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? [screams] Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! [During SpongeBob's rage, Mrs. Puff looks up these words in the dictionary that Mr. Krabs bought her, and gasps and turns bright red. SpongeBob angrily walks past Mrs. Puff while muttering, and Mr. Krabs' mouth is agape]"
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say too, Mr. Krabs. [Takes off her fur coat, shoes and hat] I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind. [Hands him some money from her purse]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs," Uh, OK."
Krusty Love,Mrs. Puff," You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs. [Mrs. Puff kisses him and his eyes bend into the shape of a heart]"
Krusty Love,Mr. Krabs, [as his eyes make a heart] Aawww...
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff," Ok, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans]"
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [leans towards Peterson] Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff, Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again]
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [again leaning towards Peterson] Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff, In no less than 800 words. [squeals and class groans again]
Procrastination,Peterson, [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that? 800 words!
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Yeah, I know!"
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff, Due tomorrow. And remember class work hard and no goofing off.
Procrastination,[back at SpongeBob's house],
Procrastination,SpongeBob," OK Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] OK, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Spotlight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [looks outside. There is a carnival. Squidward is suntanning. A boy is eating ice cream. Jellyfish are playing tennis. Gary is riding on a ball and playing a horn. Patrick is rubbing Sandy with sunscreen]"
Procrastination,Patrick," Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob sinks back down out of sight of the window]"
Procrastination,SpongeBob," It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day. Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up. cut back to SpongeBob] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only-six o'clock! [cuts to SpongeBob's ticking clock, then back to SpongeBob at his desk] Okay, here we go, here we go. [SpongeBob struggles to write] Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites Hup Ho several times. His nose and eyelashes do the same thing.] I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on pencil, make words."
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,SpongeBob, Gary! Hey hey hey Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,SpongeBob, What do you mean you're not hungry?
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,Patrick, Who is that? [picks up phone] Hello?
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?"
Procrastination,Patrick, Sleeping.
Procrastination,SpongeBob," That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the..."
Procrastination,Patrick," SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay."
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
Procrastination,Patrick," Well, I'm listening."
Procrastination,SpongeBob, Uh...Marco!
Procrastination,Patrick, Polo! [hangs up]
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long Pesky Particles! [floats back to SpongeBob chokes on one] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one."
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,SpongeBob, What do you mean 'overly dramatic?' Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry.
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,SpongeBob," I can't write on an empty stomach Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet a mailfish] Hello!"
Procrastination,Mailfish, Package for Mr. SquarePants.
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?"
Procrastination,Mailfish, It puts bread on the table.
Procrastination,SpongeBob, Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
Procrastination,Maifish, Oh brother..
Procrastination,SpongeBob," So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain..."
Procrastination,Mailfish, Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house]
Procrastination,Johnny Elaine," In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn?"
Procrastination,SpongeBob, Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle]
Procrastination,Chair," Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax."
Procrastination,SpongeBob," [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [running in the hallway and the alarms ring on the walls] Must.. get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants!"
Procrastination,Pants, Yoo hoo! Down here!
Procrastination,SpongeBob, You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
Procrastination,Pants, [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom!
Procrastination,SpongeBob," [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants...! [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. looks in the window. the candle is still lighting the clock spins and breaks that came to life]"
Procrastination,Clock," [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob..."
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [gasps the candle melts]
Procrastination,Fire Wick, Only 799 words to go! [laughs sinisterly and he burns essay and the inside of his pineapple burns]
Procrastination,SpongeBob," No! [as his house burns, he screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burnt house until it comes to life]"
Procrastination,House," SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob?! Why didn't you just write your essay?! STOP WASTING TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME!!!"
Procrastination,SpongeBob," [wakes up] Where's my essay! Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper with a word ""The"" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock..? [gasps] It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight?? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?"
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff," Oh, there you are SpongeBob."
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em."
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff," I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you.. I have to go to a teacher's convention!"
Procrastination,SpongeBob, But what about my essay?
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff, I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
Procrastination,[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself],
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff," Ok, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans]"

Procrastination,Patrick, Polo! [hangs up]
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long Pesky Particles! [floats back to SpongeBob chokes on one] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one."
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,SpongeBob, What do you mean 'overly dramatic?' Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry.
Procrastination,Gary, Meow.
Procrastination,SpongeBob," I can't write on an empty stomach Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet a mailfish] Hello!"
Procrastination,Mailfish, Package for Mr. SquarePants.
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?"
Procrastination,Mailfish, It puts bread on the table.
Procrastination,SpongeBob, Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
Procrastination,Maifish, Oh brother..
Procrastination,SpongeBob," So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain..."
Procrastination,Mailfish, Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house]
Procrastination,Johnny Elaine," In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn?"
Procrastination,SpongeBob, Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle]
Procrastination,Chair," Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax."
Procrastination,SpongeBob," [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [running in the hallway and the alarms ring on the walls] Must.. get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants!"
Procrastination,Pants, Yoo hoo! Down here!
Procrastination,SpongeBob, You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
Procrastination,Pants, [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom!
Procrastination,SpongeBob," [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants...! [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. looks in the window. the candle is still lighting the clock spins and breaks that came to life]"
Procrastination,Clock," [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob..."
Procrastination,SpongeBob, [gasps the candle melts]
Procrastination,Fire Wick, Only 799 words to go! [laughs sinisterly and he burns essay and the inside of his pineapple burns]
Procrastination,SpongeBob," No! [As his house burns, he screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burnt house until it comes to life]"
Procrastination,House," SpongeBob. Why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob?! Why didn't you just write your essay?! STOP WASTING TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME!!!"
Procrastination,SpongeBob," [wakes up. It was only a nightmare] HUH!? Where's my essay? Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper but the word ""The"" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock..? [gasps] It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight?? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?"
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff," Oh, there you are SpongeBob."
Procrastination,SpongeBob," Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em."
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff," I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you.. I have to go to a teacher's convention!"
Procrastination,SpongeBob, But what about my essay?
Procrastination,Mrs. Puff, I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
Procrastination,[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself],
I'm with Stupid,"[SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick's houses are seen. Patrick's house is shaking. SpongeBob knocks on it. Every time he does it closes. He opens it himself. Patrick is cleaning frantically. He feather-dusts SpongeBob]",
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," NEED... FURNITURE! [makes a lamp post model out of the sand, then licks it to make it remain in shape; he then makes a sand drawer, television, stool, and a couch. The whole time he is still frantically mumbling]"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Patrick, what's with the home improvement? [Patrick barks like a dog and continues to clean] Hey, Patrick!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Oooooooh, sweep sweep! [Sweeps around the walls of his house and the air]"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Patrick, I came over to see if you wanted to go jellyfishing. But I can see you're busy having an episode."
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," [Stops cleaning. His face turns mad] You know something, SpongeBob? It's just all fun and games for you. Nothing really matters. [imitates SpongeBob] ""Oh, let's go jellyfishing! We don't have any work to do! Life is just a big bowl of fancy assorted cashews, and nobody has anything to dust or to clean or to wipe! Or fabricate!"""
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," But, Patrick, the only thing I've ever seen you clean is your plate."
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," [Patrick snaps out of being angry and starts crying] I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," [gasps] Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel."
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," No, it's not that, SpongeBob; it's worse."
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Darn, I like the funnel. Well, what is it, then?"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, Look! [Takes out a rolled-up piece of paper from his belly button]
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Hey, a note! [A sixteenth note is shown]"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter! [The letter B is shown]"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, You're right!
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," And, I got this message from my parents! [Hands out a smaller letter]"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Your parents? [Reads the note out loud] ""Dear Patrick, your mom and I are coming out tomorrow for Starfish Day. Please try to remember, but don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself like last time. Love, Daddy."""
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," SpongeBob, my parents think I'm dumber than a sack of diapers."
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," No, they don't, Patrick. Parents just like to push your buttons. Like this! [pushes Patrick's nipples and his eyes elongate] Nauuugh!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, [Laughing] That always cheers me up. [His eyes go back to normal] But not today.
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is."
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, But don't they watch television?
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," That's what I'm saying, Pat! If your parents got to meet a real dummy, they'd realize what a genius you really are!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," But don't geniuses live in a lamp? And besides, we don't know any dumb people."
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Don't worry, Patrick! I'll be the dummy! When your parents see how dumb I act, they'll think you're the smartest guy ever!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, Math is power!
I'm with Stupid,[Bubble transition to the next day. Patrick is in front of his mirror],
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," A, B, C, D, E, F, G... [Doorbell rings] Oh! H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...!"
I'm with Stupid,Janet," Should I get the bullhorn again, Marty?"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," W, X, Y and Z! [Marty doesn't realize the door has been opened and knocks on Patrick's head] Hi Mom. Hi Dad."
I'm with Stupid,Marty, Son! You recognized us this time!
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, Why wouldn't I recognize my own parents?
I'm with Stupid,Marty," You never were a bright one. [Patrick groans. Marty laughs] Well, aren't you gonna show us inside?"
I'm with Stupid,Janet, He probably forgot where it is.
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, Well I know where it...
I'm with Stupid,Marty," Oh, let me lead the way so we don't get lost. [Patrick, Marty and Janet hold hands] Huh? Hold hands now! [Inside the house] Okay, we're almost there! Let go on three. One... two... three! [Marty and Janet let go of Patrick's hands on three]"
I'm with Stupid,Janet, Good job!
I'm with Stupid,Marty and Janet, Pats for Patrick! [Both laugh as Patrick looks annoyed]
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," I'll go get the beverages. [Patrick leaves, then comes back with a tray with three drinks on it]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty," Wow, son! You put the drinks in something this time! Ah, son, you must've been working all night to put these together for us."
I'm with Stupid,Janet and Marty, We love you! [Both kiss Patrick as he looks even more annoyed and groans]
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," [Doorbell rings] Hooray, the idiot's here! I mean, I'll get it!"
I'm with Stupid,"[Outside, SpongeBob is putting on his karate helmet]",
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Protective helmet, check."
I'm with Stupid,Gary, Meow.
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," I'm supposed to look stupid, Gary!"
I'm with Stupid,Gary, Meow? [Goes back to SpongeBob's house]
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, What could go wrong? [Patrick's rock opens]
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, What a surprise!
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, Hi.
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Mom, Dad, meet my neighbor, SpongeBob!"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, Hi.
I'm with Stupid,Marty, Hello there!
I'm with Stupid,Janet, How do you do?
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, Hi. [Walks to Patrick's parents]
I'm with Stupid,Marty, Put 'er there. [SpongeBob puts a doll on his hand]
I'm with Stupid,Doll, Mama! Mama!
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," He means ""shake"". [SpongeBob shakes his entire body] No, SpongeBob, no! Shake hands! [SpongeBob shakes both his hands] No, SpongeBob! Grab my dad's hand. [Puts both his hands and his left leg on Marty's hand] Grab it with only one hand! [Puts his left leg and hand down] Good boy! Now move your arm up and down! [He moves his shoulder up and down. Patrick giggles]"
I'm with Stupid,Janet," So, SpongeBob. Do you live nearby?"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, Hi.
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," No, SpongeBob. Show them your house! [SpongeBob pulls up his pants and reveals a blouse] No, not your blouse! Your house! [SpongeBob screams and runs over to his house. He runs into the shell and gets stuck]"
I'm with Stupid,Janet, He lives in a fruit?
I'm with Stupid,Marty, That's unhealthy.
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," [Giggling goofily] Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner? [SpongeBob babbles like an idiot. Later, Patrick, Marty and Janet are watching television while eating TV dinners]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty, Does he always do that after he eats?
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Only on Wednesday. [Pan over to SpongeBob pushing his nose to reveal his underwear. When he lets go, his pants pull up by themselves. This is repeated a few times. SpongeBob makes an alarm sound after that. Patrick giggles]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty," [Starts giggling with Patrick] Uh, Patrick, I think your friend might be broken."
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Yeah. And it would take more than some masking tape to fix that guy. [SpongeBob balances on his nose while making a fire truck siren sound. Makes other various sounds, including a cat yowl sound]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty, Whoa! Is he gonna be okay?
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Oh, that's nothing. [Dolphin chirping] You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling ""I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!"" [Rooster crows] He drives all the neighbors crazy! [Horn] Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- [SpongeBob jumps backwards over Patrick, Janet and Marty while making an elephant trumpet sound, then he crashes on the floor]. ---was really no help for him. [SpongeBob makes imprints of his front and back twice on the wall] I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape! I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested, [Shows closeup of SpongeBob's pants] but never box-chested! [Janet, Marty and Patrick laugh. SpongeBob frowns] Hey, SpongeBob do you have any mascara I could borrow? [Makes his eyebrows sound like elastic rubber bands]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty, [Chuckles] The boy wears make-up?
I'm with Stupid,Janet," What a card! [Everyone laughs, except SpongeBob, who's now very annoyed]"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," [Confused] Hey, Patrick! Patrick!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Aw, he said my name."
I'm with Stupid,Marty," Wow, how'd you train him to do that?"
I'm with Stupid,[SpongeBob is mad. He bites Patrick's finger],
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, Ow! He bit me!
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Patrick, meet me in the kitchen!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Oh, I guess the dummy wants to have a private conversation. [Janet and Marty laugh] A dumb one! [They laugh again, as SpongeBob and Patrick enter the kitchen] So, what's on your mind? Oh, wait, I already know the answer. Nothing! [Patrick laughs very hard] See, that's funny. 'Cause your dumb!"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Patrick, could you let up on the insults just a little bit?"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Oh, were those too complicated for you? I'll try dumb-ing them down a bit."
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Patrick, I get the feeling that you think I really am dumb! [glances at Patrick's t-shirt, ""I'M WITH THE DUMMY"" with an arrow pointing towards SpongeBob]"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are. [drools]
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," I'm only pretending to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," Oh, SpongeBob, if only you could see how stupid you sound right now, with your talk of imaginary plans. Tell you what. You've caught me at a good mood. I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act ""smart"" for everyone."
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Ok, I will! [Takes off his helmet]"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," [Puts on helmet] And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," [In front of Janet and Marty, clears throat] I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy."
I'm with Stupid,Marty," [laughs] Amazing! Three minutes in the kitchen and our son has taught him to talk in complete sentences. [Puts his right thumb up] Oh, good work, son!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick," [Puts his left thumb up] It wasn't easy, dad."
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," [sputtering] But... but, but, but, but, but, but..."
I'm with Stupid,Janet," It looks like it's time for your next lesson, young man!"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See, here's a picture of it! [He shows them a small picture of his brain]"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, That must be actual size. [All except SpongeBob laughs]
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch. [Writes on Patrick's chalkboard] 2 plus 2 equals 4."
I'm with Stupid,Marty," Hoho, son! You taught him math too!"
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob, Noooo!
I'm with Stupid,Marty," And you taught him to sing! [SpongeBob is blabbering and sputtering, then starts tensing up] Oh, now he's short-circuiting! You must have taught him a little too much."
I'm with Stupid,"[SpongeBob imagines them all laughing hard. Marty and Janet look at each other and laugh; then they all do the can-can. He imagines the three popping out of SpongeBob's pores. SpongeBob is inside Janet, who is laughing, inside Marty, who is also laughing, inside Patrick, who is also laughing, inside his eye.]",
I'm with Stupid,SpongeBob," [Screams at the top of his voice, then starts running towards the wall, crashing through the wall outside, running all the way back home]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty," You know, son, I've always known that when it comes to brightness, well, you're about a three-watt. But this guy! He's a wet match in a dark cave. He makes phone operators seem smart! [clears his throat] But more importantly, son, he's shown me what a sharp, quick-witted boy you've become. [Hugs him] Ha! I feel like I'm really meeting you for the first time. Isn't that right, Janet?"
I'm with Stupid,Janet," You bet, Marty!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, [His eyes widen] Janet? Marty? Who are you people?!
I'm with Stupid,Janet," Marty! I'm scared! [Doorbell rings, then the rock opens up. Squidward, Herb and Margie are outside his rock]"
I'm with Stupid,Squidward," Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying ""Where's Patrick?"" all day! It's driving me nuts!"
I'm with Stupid,Patrick, Mom! Dad!
I'm with Stupid,Herb," Wow, son! You actually recognized us this time."
I'm with Stupid,Margie," And you remembered to get dressed today! [Patrick, Herb and Margie laugh]"
I'm with Stupid,Marty," Oh, that's right, honey. We don't have a son."
I'm with Stupid,Janet," Oh yeah! [Both walk away. Patrick and his parents laugh as their rock closes over them, then the screen fades to black, ending the episode]"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Well, it's the worst time of the day once again. [cringes as he changes the ""Open"" sign to ""Closed""] Closing time!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs."
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Hold on there, SpongeBob! [pulls SpongeBob back in a creepy manner] Take that pile of filth out with you. [Squidward holds up a trash bag with flies flying around it]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [gasps] Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!"
Sailor Mouth,Squidward," He means this filth, you loon. [He drops the bag on the floor]"
Sailor Mouth,[SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag],
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [singing] Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash."
Sailor Mouth,[SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster],
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Hmm...dumpster writing! The voice of the people! ""Up with bubbles, down with air!"" [laughs] ""Nematodes are people too!"" [laughs] Ha, those Nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. [writes the word ""good"" after ""smells""] Good. [laughs] Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a [dolphin chirp]."
Sailor Mouth,Garbage Man, [Clearly disgusted] Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Well, sometimes, but not... Recently."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Hi, garbage man. Hi, SpongeBob."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," ""Krabs..."" Uh, isn't that the red sweaty guy you work for?"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [pointing to ""Krabs,"" then the unseen word as they are said] Nah-uh, not that word, that word."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Hmm... [dolphin chirp]! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, Sentence enhancers?
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-o! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Oh, I get it! Let me try. [clears his throat] Hello, Patrick. Lovely [dolphin chirp] day we're having, isn't it?"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This [dolphin chirp] day is particularly [dolphin chirp] lovely!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," How [dolphin chirp] right you are, Patrick!"
Sailor Mouth,[The two say the word a couple of times],
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Oh, mine too!"
Sailor Mouth,[both laugh],
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, It tingles when I laugh!
Sailor Mouth,[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day],
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Hello, customers, nice [dolphin chirp] day we're having, uh? [The customers stop eating and stare in shock]"
Sailor Mouth,Harold, [gasps] Did he just say?!
Sailor Mouth,Pirate Fish," Aye, he did."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Hey, Patrick, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," [sitting at table at the Krusty Krab] Pretty [dolphin chirp] good, SpongeBob."
Sailor Mouth,Old Man Jenkins," I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [taps on the microphone and speaks into it] Attention, customers, today's special is a [dolphin chirp] Krabby Patty served in a greasy [dolphin chirp] sauce and grilled to [dolphin chirp] perfection. [a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands] And don't forget to ask us to [dolphin chirp] the [dolphin chirp] fries. It will be our [dolphin chirp] pleasure. [Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in] Hi Squidward, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Nice [dolphin chirp] day we're having, isn't it Squidward?"
Sailor Mouth,Tom," I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue."
Sailor Mouth,Evelyn," Let's go somewhere more family oriented. [Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab, grumbling in frustration]"
Sailor Mouth,Female Fish, [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] I'm never eating here again.
Sailor Mouth,Male Fish, [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.
Sailor Mouth,[The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down. Sirens wail and a red light flashes],
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," [in the bathroom, hears the sirens] Huh? Ah! The Krusty Krab, she's empty! [runs to dining room] All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?"
Sailor Mouth,Squidward," Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom."
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Well, what was it? What'd he say?"
Sailor Mouth,Squidward," Er...he said...um, well he said..."
Sailor Mouth,[Squidward whispers],
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Huh? [Squidward whispers it again. Mr. Krabs gasps] SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," But Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Yeah, it's fancy talk."
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs, There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, You mean [dolphin chirp]?
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Yes, that one! Now quit saying that! It's a bad word!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob and Patrick, Bad word?! [both start wiping their tongues]
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use."
Sailor Mouth,Squidward, Don't you mean there are only 7?
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs, Not if you're a sailor! [laughs]
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Wow, 13!"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, That's a lot of [dolphin chirp] bad words!
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," OK, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob and Patrick, We promise.
Sailor Mouth,"[later at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing Eels and Escalators]",
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Yea, verily! Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Oh, boy, my favorite! [Flops arms up and down like a seal]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! [rolls the dice]"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, Darn. [moves game piece to eel]
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," My turn! [rolls dice] Hooray! Escalators! Yay! [screams] Up, up, up!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! [rolls dice] [sighs] Eels again."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, My turn! [rolls dice] Escalators!
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! [throws dice] Eels?"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," [rolls dice] Es-skee-lators!! [moves to escalators] Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [gets frustrated while rolling the dice] Escalators, escalators, escalators!! [dice is thrown and lands on escalators] Ha! Escalators! [dice turn over to eels]"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, Eels...
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Ah, [dolphin chirp]! [covers his mouth when he realizes his mistake]"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, Ooooh...! You said number 11!
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [babbles for Patrick to understand] I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Don't worry SpongeBob, I understand. [pause] Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [starts running to the Krusty Krab]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [starts running after him] No wait, Patrick! [after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick] Patrick, no, please don't tell!"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," But, you said ""[dolphin chirp]""! [Covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, Not if I tell first!
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, I can run faster than you! [laughs]
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," [riding in an ice cream truck] See ya at the Krusty Krab! Ha, ha, ha! [the truck goes the wrong way] Oh no!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [laughs] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," What, what, what?"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Yes, yes, yes?"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," He said, he said, he said!"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Out with it, boy!"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [talking fast] Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things."
Sailor Mouth,Mr.Krabs, [eyes SpongeBob] What kind of things?
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Well, he said..."
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs, Yes?!
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said."
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Uh... Right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," [walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone but throws away the cone] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sighs]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob and Patrick, He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, ...number thirteen...
Sailor Mouth,"[They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling, ""Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!"" Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.]",
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob and Patrick, Mmm-mmm...!
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob and Patrick," Mmm-hmm... [Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initally deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again] He said ""[dolphin chirp]""!"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," [gasps] Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. [picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab] You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. [walks back in Krusty Krab]"
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, What's going to happen to us?
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob, We'll probably get 40 lashes!
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," Oh, no! [stupidly imagines himself with 40 large, weird eyelashes]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick," I'm sorry too, SpongeBob."
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr.Krabs."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Agreed!
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for FOULING the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. [jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg] Ow, Ooh! Ow! My [dolphin chirps] foot! What  [dolphin chirps] genius puts a [dolphin chirps] rock in a [dolphin chirps] path?! Can't you see I got a [boat horn no. 1] foot here?! Oh! [seal bark!. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Five, six, seven..."
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," ...a whole lotta [old-style foghorn] and with a side of [dolphin chirp], a heapin' helpin' of [ship's bell] and a boatload of [boat horn no. 4] ..."
Sailor Mouth,Patrick, Nine...
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," [seal bark, sea gull, and a new-style foghorn]! [cries in pain]"
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," [cuts to SpongeBob with 13 fingers] That's all 13, Patrick!! [gasps] We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," [worried] No, please, not me mommy! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them] Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!"
Sailor Mouth,[They go to the house],
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob and Patrick," [repeatedly banging on the door] Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!"
Sailor Mouth,Mama Krabs," Why, hello there!"
Sailor Mouth,"[SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so!]",
Sailor Mouth,SpongeBob," Mama Krabs, he said [dolphin chirp] and then he said [dolphin chirps] again and said [dolphin chirps] and then he screamed at the top of his voice [foghorn blows]! And he--(horn honks)--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of [seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell] I have never heard in my days!"
Sailor Mouth,Mama Krabs," [shocked] Oh, dear! My poor old heart. [faints]"
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs," [gasps] Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? [takes a coin out of her pocket] You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!"
Sailor Mouth,Mama Krabs," [wakes up] You should all be ashamed! And if you're gonna talk like sailors, then you're gonna work like sailors!"
Sailor Mouth,"[Then the three are painting her house, Patrick is painting the sand]",
Sailor Mouth,Mama Krabs," I guess you three scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade! Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga! [laughs like Popeye, then stubs her foot on a rock] Yeeeoww! My [Klaxon horn] foot!"
Sailor Mouth,[SpongeBob & Patrick gasp in shock],
Sailor Mouth,Mr. Krabs, [shocked] Mother!
Sailor Mouth,Mama Krabs, What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
Sailor Mouth,Old Man Jenkins," Howdy, Mrs. K! [honks the horn]"
Sailor Mouth,"SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs", [all laugh together]
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world."
Artist Unknown,Janitor," Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer. [opens door] Welcome to art class!"
Artist Unknown,Nat," Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry. [everyone leaves except one]"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?"
Artist Unknown,Squidward, SpongeBob? In art class? Wait! This is cooking! Come back! You gotta be kidding.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," [laughs] This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?"
Artist Unknown,Squidward, You're looking at him.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven."
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Yes, please."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Well, art is not all fun and games. [as he picks up a big stack of books] It's a lot of hard... [he drops the stack, which makes SpongeBob's desk hop in the air] ...work. OK. First, repeat after me I have no talent."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, I have no talent.
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Artist Unknown,Squidward," If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacles talent will rub off on me."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," If I'm lucky,  Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. [smiles. The scene cuts to Squidward with a sad look on his face, the camera cuts back to SpongeBob and he is still smiling, the camera again cuts back to Squidward]"
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Whatever. Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one. [draws a crooked circle, then laughs] Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," How's this, Squidward?"
Artist Unknown,Squidward, What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Well, first I draw this head. [draws an amazing head] Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy."
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Gimme that. [crumples paper] Forget the circles.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. [laughs] Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Gimme that. [rips up paper] There is nothing artistic about leapfrog. [SpongeBob puts pieces together] What are you doing, now?"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," I call it Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time. [blows paper]"
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Do you want to learn art, or not?"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. And... [hits marble with tools and it becomes pieces]"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, [hits marble with tools and it becomes a perfect sculpture] How's this Squidward?
Artist Unknown,Squidward," [starry-eyed] It's beautiful! [a tear falls from his eyes] I mean, this isn't a sculpture. [SpongeBob's lip starts quivering] A good sculpture takes... more time. You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules. [SpongeBob wipes away a tear] Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong. [Squidward puts a nose like his on the sculpture] There, now it's art."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. [falls down and starts crying] I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. [crawls over to the front door and looks back at Squidward] I don't even deserve to use your doors! [the doors open, hitting SpongeBob out the window into the garbage dumpster head-first]"
Artist Unknown,Monty," Hello, there."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," But I did deserve that. [the dumpster closes on top of him] I deserved that, too. [garbage man takes SpongeBob to dump] And I deserve this!"
Artist Unknown,Monty," Good day, sir."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late."
Artist Unknown,Monty," Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags."
Artist Unknown,Squidward, The world famous art collector?
Artist Unknown,Monty, The one and only.
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Well, what are you doing here?"
Artist Unknown,Monty, I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one ""Squidward en repose""."
Artist Unknown,Monty," I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection."
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Why not?
Artist Unknown,Monty," Because, it's an art collection. [laughs]"
Artist Unknown,Squidward, How about this one? I call it Bold and Brash.
Artist Unknown,Monty, More like Belongs in the Trash. [laughs]
Artist Unknown,Janitor, Sorry. I must've missed that one. [grabs the painting and throws it in the trash]
Artist Unknown,Monty, Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh..."
Artist Unknown,Monty," Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship. This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw. [removes the nose Squidward added on and it lands on Squidward's head] Ah, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame."
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Fame. [Squidward imagines himself as popular]
Artist Unknown,Monty, Fortune.
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Fortune. [Squidward imagines himself in a tub full of money]
Artist Unknown,Monty, Anything his heart desires.
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Anything? [Squidward imagines himself with hair] It's me. It's me. I'm responsible.
Artist Unknown,Monty," I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal!! Now, uh, help me get this in the car."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," I could use a little help. [sculptures head falls off and turns into dust] My fame, my fortune, my hair."
Artist Unknown,Monty," Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off."
Artist Unknown,Monty," Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks. [laughs]"
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. I gotta find SpongeBob!! [at dump] SpongeBob...SpongeBob? SpongeBob!"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. [he slides out of the cereal box] These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them. [SpongeBob's hands pop off and run into a soup can]
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, Really?
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Really!
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, Really?
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Really!
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, Really?
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Really.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, Wow. [pause] Really?
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Let's go.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," [notices a painting in the dump] Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!"
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Gimme that. [back at classroom] Ok, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, I... can't!
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," I did it, Squidward. [draws a crooked circle]"
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Huh? But, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the..."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Uhh... [crumples paper] How about this, huh? Remember?"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," That's not in the book, either."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Forget about the book. [rips book] Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob. [he grabs a chair, puts it in front of SpongeBob's desk, and jumps up and down while holding it] What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it. [puts book back together] Ta-da! [Squidward's nose melts off his face]"
Artist Unknown,Squidward," OK, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept."
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Now you've got it.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, I've gotta embrace the marble!
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Right.
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, I've gotta sniff the marble!
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Well, uh, ok."
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, I've gotta lick the marble!
Artist Unknown,Squidward, Uhh...
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob, [washes the marble in a washing machine] I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! [expands himself so that he's the same size as the marble] I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Here you go, buddy. [hands him sculpting tools]"
Artist Unknown,SpongeBob," With this tool, I shall give birth to art."
Artist Unknown,Squidward," Oh, boy. [SpongeBob taps marble with tool and breaks into pieces]"
Artist Unknown,Monty, I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?
Artist Unknown,Squidward," As of now, it's his responsibility. [puts hat on janitor's head] Good day to you, sir. [it is revealed that when Squidward smashed all of the marble together, he created an even better sculpture than the first one and left without even seeing it]"
Artist Unknown,Monty," [to janitor] You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!"
Jellyfish Hunter,[A jellyfish flies in the sky],
Jellyfish Hunter,French Narrator," Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter."
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," La la la la, la la la la la! [SpongeBob catches it] You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you ""Twelvey."" [tickles it] Coochie coochie coo! [it sneezes out some jelly] Bye, Twelvey! [Twelvey stings him as it says goodbye and flies away. He sees a blue jellyfish] Oh! It's you! [He mimics the jellyfishes' style of floating, then tries to catch the blue jellyfish but fails] Well it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name."
Jellyfish Hunter,No Name," [buzzes] [caption reads ""Bring it on!""]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, [yells battle cries and tries to catch it. He runs. He steps on a soda can. He then runs so fast he flies] Gotcha! [he is unsuccessful at catching it] Barnacles! How'd he do that? Someday I'll catch old No Name.
Jellyfish Hunter,[cut to the Krusty Krab],
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs."
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs, You've got 5 minutes!
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch! [he imitates a rocket launching and lifts his bag into the air] [a jar of jelly and a Krabby Patty fall out of the bag. He puts the jelly on the Krabby Patty and starts eating it.] Yum!
Jellyfish Hunter,Fred," [Looks behind and stares at SpongeBob in confusion.] Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," Why, this is a hole, sir. You see, I am a sponge, and..."
Jellyfish Hunter,Fred," No, not that! [points to SpongeBob's jelly patty] That!"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Jellyfish Hunter,Fred, Could I try some?
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, Sure! [gives Fred some jellyfish jelly into his Krabby Patty]
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, No-one Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers. [Showing some fish eating jelly patties happily. Shows love hearts and extremely satisfied customers.] Here you go Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [sniffs the patty suspiciously] Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Fred," Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life! [A bill with Fred appears in it] Hey, buddy, you alright?"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [speechless, mutters incoherently]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, You okay Mr. K?
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, Oh boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," Well, keep dreaming. [Mr. Krabs gives him a jellyfish net] This'll be on your time."
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," Aye, aye, sir!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it [SpongeBob holds up a jellyfish in a jar] ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish."
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers. [Mr Krabs starts dramatizing depressing emotions] Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, [gasps] No! Never!
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs, [optimistically] Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. [leaves]"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [sinisterly, to himself] Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! [chuckles]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," [jellyfishing with many nets. He then shows up with three jars] Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [painting a sign saying ""Home of the Jelly Patty""] I'm gonna need more than that, boy."
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," [cuts a rope. Many jellyfish are inside it. He shows up with five jars] More jellies, Mr. Krabs!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [painting jellyfish on the walls of the Krusty Krab with the words ""I Love Jellyfish"" on his shirt] Oh, that'll never do. More!"
Jellyfish Hunter,"[SpongeBob has a mustache on. A sign next to a jellyfish hive reading ""FOR RENT"" is shown. Jellyfish come in. They are trapped in a large net]",

[SpongeBob manages to catch some more jellyfish with a net by jumping leftwards to the screen. Mr. Krabs now appears as a hideous caricature, popularly known as ""Moar Krabs.""] More! [SpongeBob's catching goes wildly fast. Mr. Krabs now appears normal, but continually appearing] More, more, more, more! More, more! More! [Cut to night. A sign reading ""Jellyfish Fields. Pop. 0"" is seen. ""4 Million"" is crossed out]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!"
Jellyfish Hunter,[No Name secretly follows him],
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, It feels like somebody... wants to sell me something!
Jellyfish Hunter,Businessman, [hiding behind rock with another businessman] I told you he was onto us!
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," [running away] I'm not interested in anything you're selling! [opens the door to his house and gets in] I sure felt like... [laughs] I must be working too hard. [telephone rings] I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?"
Jellyfish Hunter,No Name, [breathing]
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," [laughing nervously] Wrong number. [No Name has pliers and cuts the living room fuse and the lights go out. SpongeBob laughs nervously] I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! [door opens and a small, black figure comes in] Gary, is that you? Gary? [the figure goes inside the kitchen] Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. [light shines on a Krabby Patty with blue jellyfish jelly] Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. [gasps] Blue jelly! [No Name shows up] Hey, old No Name? What's happening?"
Jellyfish Hunter,No Name," [buzzing, shows a net and jar]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? [No Name shows a factory] Hey, I don't remember that factory! [No Name shows him the inside] Huh? [Jellyfish are inside tubes. They are being sucked of their jelly. The dried out ones are put in trash cans. SpongeBob gasps] What is this horrible place? [a robot is tickling a jellyfish]"
Jellyfish Hunter,Robot, Coochie coochie coo. [jellyfish sneezes the jelly out and dries up]
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [on an exercising machine with headphones] That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! [laughs]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do? [Mr. Krabs is listening to the song ""Give It All You've Got."" SpongeBob breaks in riding on No Name] Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," Oh, boy! A tea party! [No Name touches him] You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," Easy boy, what are you doing with that?"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, [holding an alligator wrench]  Something that should've been done a long time ago!
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs, No!
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs, [relieved] Whew!
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," And now I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful]"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs," [laughs] Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say ""open"". [Covers his mouth. The sign on the door lights the words ""OPEN"" and the jellyfish escape]"
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob, Freedom! Freedom!
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs, You'll never catch me! [He pedals but the exercising machine is bolted to the ground] Blasted exercise craze! [jellyfish sting him and he screams in pain]
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," [jellyfish escape out the doors] Goodbye, friends!"
Jellyfish Hunter,Mr. Krabs, [walks out and is incredibly burned] I'm taking jelly off the menu. [leaves]
Jellyfish Hunter,SpongeBob," He really got burned on that deal! [laughs] All is as it should be. [brings put his jellyfish net] I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! [No Name floats in SpongeBob's net. He gasps] Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... ""Friend."" [reaches his arm out. No Name does, but accidentally stings SpongeBob. He nervously smiles]"

The Fry Cook Games,Johnny," And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life. [A picture of a shadowy figure of a body with a question mark over it appears. The figure turns around and is revealed to be SpongeBob, wearing a sweatband and sports uniform. SpongeBob is standing next to Mr. Krabs, who is sitting on a bench staring at a stopwatch, then shows Ernie in a picture]"
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob starts jogging in place],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.
The Fry Cook Games,[A spotlight shines down on him and he puts his hand on his heart],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!
The Fry Cook Games,[Mr. Krabs walks away],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!"
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob starts doing pushups],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick walks up],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Hey, SpongeBob."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob stops],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Hi, Patrick."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob continues doing pushups],
The Fry Cook Games,Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!,
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob starts groaning],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games."
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Games? Can I play?
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Ah, sorry, Patrick."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob starts jumping rope],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, You have to be a fry cook.
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob tosses his jump rope behind him],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, What do you mean easy?
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick laughs],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, How hard can it be?
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties."
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!"
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick flips a rock over with his foot],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Tssss...
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Why don't you go home Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick gasps],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob gasps and points at Patrick],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, You take that back!
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob's index finger gleams. Patrick dances around],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, You don't even have fingernails.
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, I cannot believe what I am hearing!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, How can you hear it? You don't have ears either!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick stutters],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Holes! Holes!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Cone head!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Yellow!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Pink!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick screams and holds his head],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!
The Fry Cook Games,"[Patrick walks off. SpongeBob growls and starts doing pushups again, this time faster]",
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
The Fry Cook Games,[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air],
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!
The Fry Cook Games,"[Camera zooms over to Plankton, who is standing in the entranceway of the stadium. Plankton pulls out a human nose from behind him]",
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Oh yeah?! Well, I smell..."
The Fry Cook Games,[Plankton sniffs himself],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Pew! He's right.
The Fry Cook Games,"[Mr. Krabs runs over, his feet twinkling. Plankton does the same. Mr. Krabs makes a Broadway pose as corresponding music plays. Plankton makes a similar pose, holding a cane and a top hat. Mr. Krabs plays a piano, while Plankton blows into a tuba, messing up the rhythm]",
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, I love messing things up.
The Fry Cook Games,[Plankton meets up with Mr. Krabs by getting on a small platform and pulling a lever which goes up to Mr. Krabs' height],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?"
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs," Always ready, Plankton. Always ready."
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick..."
The Fry Cook Games,"[Plankton raises his arm and accidentally whacks the lever, causing him to lower again. He raises it back up]",
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, ...your carapace!
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs," That's what you think, but I got me a champion. SpongeBob! Show him!"
The Fry Cook Games,"[SpongeBob does a karate routine, using two spatulas as nunchucks, then laughs innocently when he finishes]",
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion."
The Fry Cook Games,[Plankton lowers a microphone],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor!"
The Fry Cook Games,[The crowd turns to the southeast corridor],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Other way! [quietly] Imbeciles.
The Fry Cook Games,[The crowd turns to the southwest corridor],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, And... stop! Perfect.
The Fry Cook Games,"[In the entranceway, an extremely large shadow approaches, making loud stomps on the way]",
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium. [Two parents cover up their child's eyes, and he covers theirs. Mr. Krabs' eyes sink into his shell. A muscular fish sits, trembling in the audience. He quickly gets up to leave]"
The Fry Cook Games,Muscular Fish, I gotta get outta here!
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of..."
The Fry Cook Games,"[The wall of the stadium explodes. Fish fly everywhere. When the dust clears up, a huge, purple muscular fish is seen]",
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, ...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant...
The Fry Cook Games,"[The huge fish turns around, revealing Patrick to be strapped to his back]",
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, ...Patrick Star!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick waves happily. SpongeBob stares in shock. He walks up as Patrick gets down from the huge fish's back],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook."
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants."
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick lifts up his shirt],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Check it out!
The Fry Cook Games,"[A name tag is stuck to his chest that says, ""The Chum Bucket, Patrick.""]",
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Well, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause you're gonna eat my dust."
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Nuh uh. I'm eating my own dust!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Not if I eat it first!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Yellow!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Pink!
The Fry Cook Games,[The two walk away],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend."
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, Friend? Not in here he ain't.
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, What do you mean?
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, He's not really your friend.
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, He's not?
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, He's plotting your downfall right now!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, He is?
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, He's gonna stab you in the back.
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, He wouldn't!
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Of course he would. Just look at him. Square the shape of evil!
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, No!
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Then get mean!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, I'm mean!
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, Get angry!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, I'm angry!
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Now get out there!
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, And win...
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, That...
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, Medal!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, [screams]
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, [screams]
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob and Patrick, [both scream]
The Fry Cook Games,Huge Fish, Ahhh.
The Fry Cook Games,[Scene cuts to the first event],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny," Our first event, the deep fry pole vault. [A deep fryer labeled ""Fry King"" sits in front of two high poles. SpongeBob stands in front of Mr. Krabs, holding a long pole]"
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, Win this one for the Krusty Krab.
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, For the Krusty Krab!!! [SpongeBob flips over the poles and the deep fry and splats down on the circle drawn in the ground. The crowd gasps. SpongeBob forms a number one sign and the crowd cheers]
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Win this one because I told you to.
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Because you told me to! [Patrick flips over the poles but lands on the handle of the deep fryer, flinging it at the crowd and turning them into fish sticks. A vendor walks up and turns on a heat lamp]"
The Fry Cook Games,Vendor, Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!
The Fry Cook Games,"[Scene cuts to the second event. SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of a tall ladder that leads to a diving board, perched above a bowl of chocolate syrup]",
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, The next event the chocolate high dive.
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob climbs up the ladder],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny," For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks."
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob holds up two popsicle sticks and sticks them into the top of his head],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny," And now, absolute silence."
The Fry Cook Games,[The crowd stops chattering. SpongeBob jumps off the diving board],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," I scream for ice cream! [SpongeBob flips around a couple times, then leaps toward the bowl. He lands in the chocolate syrup getting coated in it, then hops out of it and into a sandbox full of toasted almonds]"
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob lands in the circle],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, He stuck it!
The Fry Cook Games,[SpongeBob turns around toward the camera and grins],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, And just look at that even coating.
The Fry Cook Games,"[SpongeBob walks upside-down past Patrick, using the popsicle sticks for legs]",
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Top that, Pinky."
The Fry Cook Games,[Plankton walks up],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!"
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick groans],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Better than you!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick groans louder],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!
The Fry Cook Games,"[Patrick screams, then hops up onto the diving board with the lower half of his body inside an ice cream cone]",
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick slowly leans off the edge until he falls off the diving board],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, Just look at that concentration.
The Fry Cook Games,"[Patrick splashes into the bowl, with chocolate syrup flying everywhere]",
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny," Ooh, a little shaky on that entrance."
The Fry Cook Games,[A live action strawberry cone with a chocolate dip is shown],
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, But just look at that form!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick hops up to SpongeBob grinning while SB is very angry about losing],
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Take that, yellow boy!"
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet."
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," That's what you think, but it's not over yet."
The Fry Cook Games,"[A clip of highlights from the games is shown, beginning with SpongeBob tossing a patty. Patrick skates on a large grill with butter on his feet. Patrick tosses a large bottle of ketchup up in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick race on a track carrying trays full of food; the two fly up in the air on two large spatulas. They both do a dance wearing colorful outfits and fruit hats. The clip ends. A large arena on top of a hamburger is on screen. The realistic Fish Head is still reporting]",
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny," It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?"
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs," [rubbing SpongeBob's shoulders] Don't forget, he called ye yellow."
The Fry Cook Games,"[SpongeBob picks up a metal chain and bites off and chews up the middle of it. He bares his teeth, revealing the metal chain to now be attached to them like braces]",
The Fry Cook Games,Johnny, Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton," Don't forget, he called you pink!"
The Fry Cook Games,"[Plankton hops away. Patrick growls as he picks up a lemon, rips it in half, puts both halves into each of his eyes and screams]",
The Fry Cook Games,"[Heavy metal music plays. The bell rings. SpongeBob tears off his blue robe, showing off his extremely large, muscular body. Patrick rips off his own green robe, underneath which he is wearing a business suit. He tears off the business suit, also revealing an extremely large, muscular body. The two dive at each other, screaming, until they collide. They wrestle and continue to wind up in twisted positions. They spin around and wind up wrestling with themselves. They realize this, and dive back at each other. Patrick sits on top of SpongeBob, holding his foot]",
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.
The Fry Cook Games,"[Patrick takes off SpongeBob's shoe and licks his foot slowly. SpongeBob screams in agony. The two wrestle again. SpongeBob sits on Patrick's chest and lifts up a pencil with the eraser side pointing toward Patrick. He slowly brings it down to his name tag and erases the ""Pat"" in ""Patrick"", leaving ""rick""]",
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, [screams] Noooo! My name's... not... Rick!
The Fry Cook Games,[Patrick tackles SpongeBob and the two wrestle once more before they stop],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, I don't like you!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, I don't like you more!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, I never liked you!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, I a thousand times never liked you!
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Pink!
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Yellow!
The Fry Cook Games,[They struggle to push each other until both of their pants rip and fall down. Patrick's underwear is yellow. SpongeBob's underwear is pink],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob, Yellow?
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, Pink?
The Fry Cook Games,[Their eyes start to water],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob and Patrick, You do care!
The Fry Cook Games,[They both start crying and hug each other],
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," Let's promise never to fight again, buddy."
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," Yeah, pal. Let's go home."
The Fry Cook Games,[The two friends walk off whistling and holding hands. The crowd boos. Mr. Krabs runs up],
The Fry Cook Games,Mr. Krabs, Hey! Where ya going?
The Fry Cook Games,[Plankton runs up next to Mr. Krabs],
The Fry Cook Games,Plankton, Get back here and kill each other!
The Fry Cook Games,"[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the stadium, arms on each other's backs]",
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick, You're my best friend ever.
The Fry Cook Games,SpongeBob," You too, Patrick."
The Fry Cook Games,Patrick," You know, these were white when I bought 'em."
Squid on Strike,"[The episode opens at The Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office with an adding machine, singing]",
Squid on Strike,[His eyes bug out at the ticker tape and he gasps],
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
Squid on Strike,"[Meanwhile, Squidward is helping Martha in his ordering boat at the dining area of the Krusty Krab]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward, Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
Squid on Strike,"[Gives Martha a dollar, and she walks off. Mr. Krabs approaches him]",
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, Mr. Squidward!
Squid on Strike,Squidward, What?
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," What's with all this ""change"" nonsense?"
Squid on Strike,"[SpongeBob walks over, knotting his tie]",
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home."
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up! [Squidward becomes exasperated, and takes a deep breath]"
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
Squid on Strike,Squidward, You hardly pay us at all!
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you."
Squid on Strike,[He hands his employees envelopes],
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Ah, yes! Our meager restitution. [He takes the envelope and smells it] Ah, the sweet smell of payday. [He opens it and enclosed is a pair of underwear] Huh?"
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning. [Trades envelopes with him] Here's your check."
Squid on Strike,[He gives SpongeBob an envelope as well],
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," And here's yours, SpongeBob."
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. Grilling is my passion!"
Squid on Strike,[Mr. Krabs greedily snatches it back],
Squid on Strike,Squidward," What is this!?! [He sees that there is a bill instead of a check. It charges Squidward for breathing, talking, standing, existing, lollygagging, and chewing] You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?"
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it."
Squid on Strike,"[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, preparing money for him]",
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. [Mr. Krabs is drooling over SpongeBob's cash, and Squidward pulls SpongeBob towards him]"
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same."
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Why?
Squid on Strike,Squidward," We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Wow! You and me go on strike?
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Sure! After all, you like your job, right?"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Right!
Squid on Strike,Squidward," And you want to keep working here, right?"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Right!
Squid on Strike,Squidward," And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Right!
Squid on Strike,Squidward, Then let's go on strike!
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Yay! A strike!
Squid on Strike,[He starts to sing excitedly],
Squid on Strike,[He inadvertently kicks Mr. Krabs in the butt as Krabs sweeps the floor],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!"
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, A strike?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Yeah.
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, You mean you're going to make picket signs?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Yeah.
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, And you're going to make protest speeches?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Yeah, yeah!"
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, And you're going to demand me respect?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Yeah! [Cut to SpongeBob sobbing outside of the Krusty Krab] Noo...
Squid on Strike,[Squidward is with him],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was going to get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I... [He cries more] Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm going to be sick."
Squid on Strike,Squidward, SpongeBob!
Squid on Strike,"[He grabs SpongeBob and pulls him off the door, but his arms and legs stick]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward," News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too! [SpongeBob is suctioned to the door. Squidward pulls him off again, and this time his face remains pressed against the door] This is exactly why we need to go on strike. [SpongeBob flies back to the door. Squidward pulls him off once more, and this time SpongeBob's front sticks to the door, and we can see his skeleton and internal organs on his other side] He can't treat us like this anymore!"
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob goes back to the door and Squidward's eyes become bloodshot],
Squid on Strike,Squidward," He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap."
Squid on Strike,"[SpongeBob and Squidward look through the door to see Mr. Krabs blowing dust off his old ""Help Wanted"" sign]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united!"
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob holds Squidward's hand],
Squid on Strike,Squidward, Ahem.
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob withdraws his hand],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Sorry.
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time you'll have your job back and more."
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, And more?
Squid on Strike,"[He imagines himself in his Krusty Krew uniform hat, except his hat is slightly bigger]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Alright SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms, [He takes off his hat] they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so. [Squidward throws it into the ground and stomps on it] Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob."
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob hesitantly takes his hat off],
Squid on Strike,Squidward," That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground."
Squid on Strike,"[SpongeBob attempts to do so, but the hat sticks to his hand despite the fact he no longer has any grip on it]",
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," [screams in frustration] I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me."
Squid on Strike,Squidward," SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground."
Squid on Strike,"[A police fish walks up to Squidward with a ticket in a scene similar to the one in ""Bossy Boots""]",
Squid on Strike,Officer John," Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter."
Squid on Strike,"[He sticks the ticket to Squidward's forehead and leaves. Later, Squidward and SpongeBob are painting signs]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking."
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob holds up a picket fence on a stick],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Like this, Squidward?"
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!"
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob holds up a sign that has a finger picking a nose],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, How's this?
Squid on Strike,Squidward," ...No. [Picks up his] This is a picket sign Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point. [SpongeBob holds up his similar one that reads ""Krusty Krab Funfair""]"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," How's this, Squidward?"
Squid on Strike,Squidward," SpongeBob, it's ""unfair,"" not ""funfair""!"
Squid on Strike,[A fish walks by],
Squid on Strike,Sandals, A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, At the Krusty Krab.
Squid on Strike,Sandals," Hey everybody! Let's go to the fun fair! [A crowd of fish trample Squidward to get the restaurant. Later, SpongeBob is holding a sign that says ""No Fair!"" on it]"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
Squid on Strike,[A teenager fish with a cap and braces walks up],
Squid on Strike,Teenage Fry Cook, What the heck does that mean?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
Squid on Strike,Teenage Fry Cook, Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Yep!
Squid on Strike,Teenage Fry Cook," Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?"
Squid on Strike,[He pulls out a pen],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Anything for an aspiring fry cook. [SpongeBob signs the spatula] So, did you come down to help out the cause?"
Squid on Strike,Teenage Fry Cook," No, I came to take your job."
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob is shocked. The fish grabs his spatula and pen and runs into the Krusty Krab to apply for a job],
Squid on Strike,Teenage Fry Cook," Hey, thanks, dude!"
Squid on Strike,"[Squidward walks up and bellows at SpongeBob through the megaphone so loudly that his facial features fall off, and he flies away.]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker! [SpongeBob inserts his eyes into their sockets] You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat."
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," I'm sorry, Squidward. [He holds up a sign reading, ""I Heart the Krusty Krab""] How about I try the signs again?"
Squid on Strike,Squidward, [into megaphone] Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob stands next to a telephone pole],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Like this, Squidward?"
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect. [We see that SpongeBob is now hidden behind the telephone pole. As Squidward begins to speaks, a crowd gathers] Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!"
Squid on Strike,Miss Shell, I knew it!
Squid on Strike,[She slaps Dennis],
Squid on Strike,Squidward, The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!
Squid on Strike,[The crowd cheers],
Squid on Strike,Archie," Hey, what's that guy talking about?"
Squid on Strike,Francis," I don't know, but he's got a megaphone."
Squid on Strike,Squidward," We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!"
Squid on Strike,[The crowd cheers],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," [From behind pole] Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing."
Squid on Strike,Squidward," With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!"
Squid on Strike,"[He speaks into Fred's face, and his eyes shoot into the back of his head. Then, they return to their sockets. Everyone cheers]",
Squid on Strike,Billy (lime fish)," Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry."
Squid on Strike,Sandals," Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty."
Squid on Strike,"[Everyone cheers and run into the Krusty Krab, once again trampling Squidward]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward, Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.
Squid on Strike,[SpongeBob walks up to him],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands."
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... Squidward, what was that other part?"
Squid on Strike,Squidward, Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Yeah, that too!"
Squid on Strike,[Mr. Krabs pretends to yawn and leaves],
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
Squid on Strike,"[Squidward's eyes become bloodshot. SpongeBob's voice echoes ""forever"" in Squidward's mind as he opens the door to his house, takes a bath, looks in the mirror, and sits in bed, wide-eyed. He seems to have a case of insomnia as the word haunts him]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward," On strike with SpongeBob... forever? [He imagines himself as an old man with a white beard holding a sign reading, ""Krusty Still Unfair."" Cobwebs branch from him to the ground. An old SpongeBob approaches him, supported by a cane]"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is going to break any day. [tugs Squidward's beard] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [bonks Squidward on the head with his cane] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [floats around Squidward] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?"
Squid on Strike,[Squidward sits up in bed and screams],
Squid on Strike,Squidward, I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
Squid on Strike,"[He runs to the door and opens it, and Krabs is there in his nightclothes, about to knock on it]",
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy. [He grovels at Squidward's feet] The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone!"
Squid on Strike,Teenagers," Alright, Mr. Krabs!"
Squid on Strike,[They give him the thumbs up],
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," See what I mean? Squidward, please, you got to come back."
Squid on Strike,Squidward, You'll give us anything we want?
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?"
Squid on Strike,Squidward," Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms."
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! [He kicks open his front door, hammer and saw in hand. He runs to the Krusty Krab and into the dining room] I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! [He pulls up a loose floorboard. He then saws a table in half] I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! [He takes a bite out of a wooden column. Mouth full] Squidward will be so proud!"
Squid on Strike,"[Cut to Squidward and Krabs, now fully dressed, walking to the Krab at dawn]",
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations."
Squid on Strike,Squidward," I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs."
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!"
Squid on Strike,"[Squidward sees a disassembled Krusty Krab and screams. Krabs seems not to notice and hums as he puts his key where the door used to be, unlocking nothing. SpongeBob peeks out from the mangled sign pole. He runs out, trying to hold in his laughter]",
Squid on Strike,Squidward, S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure."
Squid on Strike,"[Krabs walks through the rubble of the Krusty Krab, oblivious, and sits in his chair. Only then does he see the debris. Only the floor and base of the walls remain, so when he looks straight ahead from his chair, he can see Squidward and SpongeBob at the dilapidated door frame. Krabs' arms pop off followed by his eyes. His head slides off his torso and onto the floor where his nose falls out of it. Then his pelvis and legs fall out of his chair]",
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs, Squidward! SpongeBob!
Squid on Strike,"[SpongeBob is excited, but Squidward is nervous]",
Squid on Strike,Both," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob, Here it comes!
Squid on Strike,Mr. Krabs," In order to pay off these damages, you two are going to work for me forever!"
Squid on Strike,SpongeBob," Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!"
Squid on Strike,"[""Forever"" once again echoes inside Squidward's mind, and the camera zooms in on his bloodshot eyes]",
Squid on Strike,Narrator, One eternity later...
Squid on Strike,"[We see the Krusty Krab full of dust, but not customers. Cobwebs are everywhere. A skeleton Squidward brushes off the floor, and a skeleton SpongeBob waits in the ordering boat]",
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",French Narrator," Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom. Listen to the tropical tranquility. [we see the town of Bikini Bottom; something underground is tunneling and consumes the Bikini Bottom sign] Uh-oh. [the tunneling thing moves on to the rest of Bikini Bottom; a cop is writing a ticket for a car parked near a fire hydrant; the thing, still invisible, makes eating noises; we then see that the car has disappeared, so the cop picks up the fire hydrant, moves it to the adjacent car, and places the ticket on that car, whistling as he walks away; the thing moves on to SpongeBob's house; Gary wakes up, sees the thing, and meows in terror; SpongeBob is still fast asleep]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [mumbling, half-asleep] Trick-or-treat. Thank you. [the thing takes SpongeBob's blanket] You keep the change. [the thing takes SpongeBob's pillow] What? [he wakes up fully and stares fixedly at the thing in terror; camera zooms out to show half of the pineapple house's walls missing; new scene shows SpongeBob talking to a crowd at the Krusty Krab] I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Patrick," That's horrible! [gobbles down a whole tray of food, containers and all]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! [each of the three words appears on screen; ""Alaskan"" in an icy form, ""Bull"" in a furry text, and ""Worm!"" with different worms forming the word. The crowd murmurs worriedly]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Fred, He ate my wheelbarrow! [he has his wheelbarrow with a bite taken out of it]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Nancy Suzy Fish, He ate my children's homework! [her two kids wink simultaneously and give a big thumbs-up]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Awesome Fish/Fish 3, [has a huge bite taken out of his butt] Do I need to say it?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Fish 4, [crowd murmurs some more] How can we protect ourselves?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Mr. Krabs, I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty! [crowd boos and throws ketchup and mustard bottles at him]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Fish 5, We should lock our doors!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Mable, We should call my nephew!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Knight Fish, We should dig a moat!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Patrick," We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else! [crowd immediately quiets down]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Squidward, That idea may just be crazy enough... to get us all killed! [crowd resumes fretting]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Patrick, [Amongst the murmuring] What's wrong with my idea?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Fish 1, Let's get someone to go after it!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Mr. Krabs," There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm! [a horrible screeching noise is heard; the crowd cringes; we see a scary-looking old guy in a raincoat with a hook for a hand, scraping it on the window of the Krusty Krab; he stops]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Unnamed Sailor, You got a bathroom in this place?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Mr. Krabs, [looks slightly peeved] In the back.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Unnamed Sailor, [legs wobble] Thanks. [he runs for it]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," [under a wide-brimmed cowboy hat] I'll catch your worm for ya, that is, if'n you're willing to pay! [tips brim up]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Mr. Krabs, No! You'll never get a cent out of me! [runs to block the cash register with his body] Never! I'd rather that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive! [begins foaming at the mouth; the crowd looks at him strangely; he calms down] Sorry.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," [laughs good-naturedly] Aw shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all. [Mr. Krabs chuckles, which gradually turns into crying; Sandy continues] Nope. I'm gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone! [she shows them; crowd gasps] Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward! [crowd sympathizes] I am gonna get back what's mine! [crowd cheers]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [looks alarmed] What? But Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! [the three words appear on screen again]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here. [she pulls out a wallet with pictures] Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms. [we see pictures of a real-life squirrel with a lasso around a bull, then a lasso around a worm] Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw! [she runs to the doors of the Krusty Krab; the crowd goes wild]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," But Sandy, you don't know!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long. [leaves]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, [chases after her] Sandy! Sandy!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Mr. Krabs," [amidst the still-cheering crowd] Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you! [crowd stops; Mr. Krabs turns to Patrick] Now, what was that idea of yours?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Patrick, PUSH! [new scene shows all the citizens trying to push the buildings of Bikini Bottom; cuts back to SpongeBob chasing after Sandy]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Wait! Sandy!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Sandy, don't go!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Why not?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink! [each word appears on the screen; ""Big"" displayed in large text, ""Scary"" in green drippy text, and ""Pink"" in a girly pink text]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that neither!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, You'll get massacred! [collapses into sponge-cubes]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different ""big""s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [unconvincingly] Um, I do?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, You do? Where?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Um... in my pocket.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on! [SpongeBob looks nervous, pulls something from his pocket, and opens his hand] SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [shakes head] No, it's not. This is your tail."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, [annoyed] SpongeBob!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [defensively] How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! [he jumps onto the front of Sandy's air helmet and hugs it]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," [pulls him off] SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for, and there ain't nothing you can say to stop me! [resumes walking]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Oh yeah? What if I said... 'blargen fedibble no-hip'?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," [stops] Well, I gotta admit, that slowed me down, but I'm still going for him! [continues]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [appears next to Sandy as she strides along] You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home. [Sandy keeps walking; SpongeBob reappears] I've got ice cream! With nuts... [Sandy continues; SpongeBob appears once more, this time with a goofy squirrel mask on his face] Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, You ain't my pa!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [stands in front of her with boxing gloves] Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me! [Sandy pushes through his body as if walking through a pair of swinging doors; he grabs her ankles, crying] Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [still crying and holding onto her ankles] No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom? [she grabs an anchor and pulls a boat down from the surface]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, You are.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, ""K"" in karate? [makes a K shape]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, [makes a U shape] You did.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," [his butt has ""Property of Sandy Cheeks"" printed on it, states it meekly] You do."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Okay.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Say it.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, There isn't anything...
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Ain't nothin'!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, [in a high-pitched voice like Sandy] Ain't nothin' [normal voice] too big or too ornery for you to catch. But... [Sandy cuts him off] But... [cuts him off again] And... [cuts him off again] We... [cuts him off again] I... [cuts him off again] Yeah but...
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, No!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, You see...
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, No!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, I... [Sandy cuts him off one last time with a frustrated groan]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," [picks up some sand from the ground as if tracking an animal and sniffs it] Worm sign. [she holds a small sign in her palm that has ""WORM"" painted on it; looks up] He's in that cave."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Sandy, are you sure you...?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew. [she walks into the cave; SpongeBob hides behind a rock and shudders; we hear Sandy inside the cave] Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah! [we hear karate noises; Sandy peeks out of the cave] I'm winnin', SpongeBob! [resumes fighting]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Sandy, that's not...! [more fighting noises; Sandy peeks out again]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, This shouldn't take long. [resumes fighting]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Sandy, that's not...!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Almost done!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Sandy!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Yee-haw! [comes out riding a pink segmented thing] I got him, SpongeBob! [makes a giant knot and stands on it proudly]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, [still uneasy] Sandy...?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail! [we see that she has tied the fur to the small remainder of her tail]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, That's not the worm.
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Pardon?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, That's not the worm. That's his tongue. [camera zooms out to show that SpongeBob is right; the opening of the cave is actually the worm's open mouth; his eyes make a squishy blinking noise]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm. [freaks out] Run for your life! [they sprint away; the worm growls angrily, chomps down, and chases after them]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," So what's the plan, Sandy? [they look back and see that the worm is approaching faster]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Run faster!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Later!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," Not now, SpongeBob!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, I wanna hear you say it!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Can we talk about this another time?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Say it!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, SpongeBob!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Say it, or I'll trip you! [he continues running on one foot, the other poised to trip Sandy]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, No!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Say it!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Not now!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Say it!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," All right! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," I knew it. [the worm emits another huge growl; prompting the two to run even faster; they run up and down a sand mound, which the worm plows right through; they run past Fish 3, who is leaning over under his car's hood; his butt is bandaged up; the worm passes by and takes another bite out of him]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Fish 3, Not again!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," Uh, Sandy?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, Yeah?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, What do we do now?
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," [is panting and sweating; the worm growls again; Sandy sees the seemingly endless coral trees in front of them] I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob," I'm way ahead of you, Sandy. [fashions a necklace out of them] Look, it's a necklace! S for ""SpongeBob"" or S for ""Sandy""! That way they can identify our bodies."
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy," No, silly! How about S for ""save our skins""? [she takes the string and uses the hook of the paper clip to wrap the string around one of the coral trees; she grabs SpongeBob and swings them up and over the branch onto the worm's back] Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here. [the worm starts to plow off a cliff like a runaway train; Sandy and SpongeBob realize this, scream, and begin running toward the end of worm to the safety of the plateau; they jump off safely as the worm falls off the cliff] We did it!"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Yay! He'll never get out of there!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Sandy, We saved the town!
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",SpongeBob, Yay! Let's go tell everybody! [new scene shows all the citizens still trying to push Bikini Bottom to safety; the city is now in the valley at the bottom of the cliff]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Patrick, PUSH! [citizens push the city] Push! [push one last time]
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Citizens," Hooray! [the worm, still falling, lands on the city and smashes it to bits]"
"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm",Worm, Ouuuuuch.
