Shanghaied,SpongeBob,i don't know squidward that ship has a spooky green glow around it

Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,the slash-bringing hasher
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,the hash-slinging slasher
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,the sash-ringing the trash-singing mash-flinging the flash-springing ringing the cr-crash-dinging daa
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,yes the hash-slinging slasher but most people just call him the ha because that's all they have time to say before he gets them
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,tell me the story
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,years ago at this very restaurant the hash-slinging slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier and then one night when he was cutting the patties it happened
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,he forgot the secret sauce
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,no
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,he didn't wash his hands
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,no
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,irregular portions
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,no he cut off his own hand by mistake
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,you mean like this or like this or this or this but what about this or this or this or this or
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,except he wasn't a sponge
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,so
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,so it didn't grow back
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,oh no
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,and he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula and then he got hit by a bus and at his funeral they fired him so now every what day is it
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,tuesday
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,tuesday night his ghost returns to the krusty krab to wreak his horrible vengeance
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,but tonight's tuesday night
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,then he'll be coming
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,how will we know
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,there are three signs that signal the approach of the hash-slinging slasher first the lights will flicker on and off next
Graveyard Shift,Harold,dude can i have some ketchup
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,oh here you go next the phone will ring and there will be nobody there and finally the hash-slinging slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,no
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,he opens the door he slowly approaches the counter and you know what he does next
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,what
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,you really want to know
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,what
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,are you sure you want to know
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,what what what does he do

Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,the hash-slinging slasher
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,at last you understand we're doomed
Graveyard Shift,SpongeBob,no that's not it i am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street just to entertain me you must really like me
Graveyard Shift,Squidward,spongebob there are two problems with your theory one - i hate you and two - how can that be me when i'm standing right here
