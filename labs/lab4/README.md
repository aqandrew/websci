MixDiagnose is meant to give Spotify users a clearer idea of what kind of music is represented in each of their daily mixes.

I was inspired by having only recently discovered the Daily Mix. On Spotify, the mixes are not named, and reference only artist names.

# Observations
I skipped my initial idea (to give a user more information about their Daily Mixes), because I could not get my app to make API calls that required OAuth.

# Questions
Can we cover and demonstrate authorization in class?
^What about flexbox?
Even though .album-art is floated right, why does it display below than headings which are floated left?
How come I couldn't emulate this CodePen with this lab? http://codepen.io/klamping/pen/WvvgBX?editors=110
I figured CSS columns would be the best way to handle responsiveness with dynamic elements. But why do divs in the the right column become hidden  when the columns reach the minimum size?
